So bought a few AMD leap calls EOY 2022 when AI just started booming (ChatGPT), figured semi-conductor demand would blow up and looks like I wasn’t all wrong. 

Not sure if should’ve held today or sold. Felt like taking a screenshot of +600% which itself triggered the signal, if it’s worth taking a screenshot then it’s worth selling so I bitched out and did. Especially with Debt Ceiling talks next week.

Can anyone give me some insight, or explain it to me like im 5?Imma be real, seeing NVDA skyrocket Wednesday really fucking pissed me off. Stopped buying the market in February thinking a correction was right around the corner. I've made a couple bucks since but a majority of my cash is sitting on the sidelines. Its starting to feel like a correction is never coming. 

But I know as soon as I ape in the market will fucking tank.

I know a lot of people are in a similar place.

When's the dump coming if it is at all?I literally always lose money.  No matter what I do, puts, calls, TSLA, SPY, AMD, AAPL, I lose money.  When I cut my losses, my position reverses and makes a ton of money.  When I diamond hands, I ride that shit into the ground and walk away with 0.  

What in the hell dude.  Yesterday I bought some TSLA calls, it made a bit of gains but then I sold it because TSLA had been going up for a few days now.  I bought NVDA puts because how could it possibly go up another day after a 25% ripper??  Yet here we are, it did go up for another green day and my puts lost 40%.  

So fuck it, here I am now, sold the NVDA puts, got some SPY puts.  SPY is at 420 now, it's reached 420 a couple times in the past and has always bounced off it and gone back down, so that's what I'm hoping for.  But with my luck it'll break through it and break out to like 440 or some shit.After being a silly bear- erasing all my life savings with NVIDIA puts, I have decided to become ultra bear.

The Hypothesis:

US debt ceiling deal will not happen, and the US will default on its debt. Probability of this happening is ~0%. However as a regarded bear, I will see it coming. In the week that follows no deal will be met, the US government will freeze for a period of time. In this time, China will seize Taiwan, as no body will stop them.

The play:

500 VIX calls so far out the money, there is only a premium of 100-150 dollars. If they print- insta retire.

The second play: swap the income for BTC/ETH whilst the dollar crumbles. Then gains tax->0.&#x200B;

The blue line is where ER happened

the set ups are fucking identical and i see the same morons shorting this ATH break while saying "this time is different" ironically

this time is never different, NVDA will roll over eventually but first stop is a blow off topAnyone remember AMD back in 2012-2015? I remember buying in when it was about $3 (a whole $50 at the time) and following it as earnings came in and the company was on a positive track but the stock kept going down. The upsides with Crypto, Machine Learning, and other processing power heavy technologies just around the corner yet the stock continued to be barely hanging on to life, then  suddenly the stock took off as it began to show the earnings reported weren't temporary but long-term strategic growths.

&#x200B;

Right now I'm looking at SPCE with similar vibes, here's why.

Just a few years ago Space Tourism was predicted to be a growing and potential multi-billion dollar per year industry.

Here's some charts because we all like pictures.

https://preview.redd.it/2i7wr1a1z82b1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fcacfa97145c62d2c624c53e1d880b3e02f7f6bc

https://preview.redd.it/xn0d0p42z82b1.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=836ae96bef9b557c59ec7d03b51b8fa54f00cec7

But why SPCE? Why not AMZN or SpaceX?

It all comes down to: Affordability, Availability, and Astronaut-ability.

# Affordability:

* Virgin Galactic Ticket Price: **$450,000** (Target market: Millionaires)
* Blue Origin Ticket Price: **$1,250,000** (Target market: Multi-millionaires)
* SpaceX Ticket Price: **$55,000,000** (Target market: Governments & Billionaires)

# Availability:

* Virgin Galactic Yearly Capacity: 400 Flights (planned) / 2,400 Persons
* Blue Origin Yearly Capacity: 52 Flights (estimate) / 312 Persons
* SpaceX Yearly Capacity: 61 Flights (proven) / 427 Persons

# Astronaut-ability:

* Virgin Galactic flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA
* Blue Origin flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA
* SpaceX flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA

That's right, they all qualify! The FUD over the Kármán line is pure marketing by Blue Origin and SpaceX as well as SPCE bears. The FAA recognizes commercial astronauts (tourists) **who fly to a height of 50 miles or higher.** (see below)

https://preview.redd.it/cjf86qh3z82b1.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6b72d5c11673ca30c7d8348cb499a19a0ce72b44

Link: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial\_astronaut#:\~:text=The%20FAA's%20Commercial%20Astronaut%20Wings,an%20FAA%2FAST%20licensed%20mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_astronaut#:~:text=The%20FAA's%20Commercial%20Astronaut%20Wings,an%20FAA%2FAST%20licensed%20mission).

So in summary it's the millionaire version of the Lady & Lord established title thing, except it's real.

Why go to school for 6 years and be a Doctor if you could add "astronaut" to the end of everything for the same amount of money? If someone is willing to throw out millions on a yacht slightly larger than their peers, why won't they drop the money on a spaceflight?

&#x200B;

That all brings me back to why the stock is tanking, they just had a successful test flight of their new craft and the stock is down 15% today. Maybe it's "priced in" but my guess is that the FUD is getting laid on thick since it is becoming likely that SPCE will be a serious market competitor, potentially taking sales away from Blue Origin or SpaceX, but the reality is that the market is so much larger than current  capacity ([https://www.valuepenguin.com/travel/americans-space-travel](https://www.valuepenguin.com/travel/americans-space-travel)) and it will take decades to saturate that market. Virgin Galactic is the only relatively affordable spaceflight option right now and if it goes away, space tourism will be a thing only accessible by the ultra-wealthy.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I like the stock, but I'm probably regarded, so that's why I like it. Or maybe I've had too much caffeine today. This is not financial advice, this is the dumpster behind a wendys.

PS: I wish I could flair this "shallow dive" as I'm not that smart on stocks, I still own the stock that must not be named💎👐.Nerdwallet is one of my current favorite OTM calls. Hovering at all time low, solid report, plenty of cash on hand, and misunderstood. 

Nerdwallet provides different public facing financial services, most through affiliate programs with credit cards, banks etc. 

Now what the general public seems to have forgotten is that Nerdwallet isn't the end-lender in those deals. Generally they simply take a cut when a customer signs up for a service via their website. 

In a consumer credit crisis, many people not only need to get a credit card, they will also roll their balance etc. and Nerdwallet is there to capitalize on all of this. 

At under $10 NRDS is in my opinion pretty much free money. Sitting on some shares, and June 16th $10 calls.[Option Summary](https://preview.redd.it/gf8cjvo6c72b1.png?width=3180&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a8120e51c0027efdbdd901acc8f349f7bebb0be9)

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-26.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean "cheaper." High numbers mean "expensive." A 1 means "fairly" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have "weeklies", the underlying is "too cheap", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.
* **How should this be improved?** Do you have any suggestions or notice any bugs with this report?**Money market funds are the hottest thing since SPACs in 2020.**

And I'll prove it to you:

In 2023, we’ve seen investors dump over $756 billion into these funds this year.

*What is a money market fund?*

A money market fund is essentially a mutual fund, but instead of investing in all forms of securities, the money market fund’s focus is on highly liquid, short-term instruments. Examples include Cash and Cash Equivalents, short-term debt instruments such as U.S. Treasuries, and commercial paper.

**Overview of the money flow to money market funds this year:**

As you can see, the money market is the hottest kid on the block and will likely continue to be so.

*Why is this happening?*

Rising interest rates: Rising interest rates have pushed up the yields available on money market funds, in turn attracting investors.

*Liquidity:* Money market funds offer liquidity, unlike other investments that may tie up capital for an extended period. Investors value liquidity during times of economic uncertainty.Here are what you regards should know about the current debt-ceiling situation. \[Source\]([https://www.wsj.com/articles/debt-ceiling-crisis-wall-street-acc4b5a7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/debt-ceiling-crisis-wall-street-acc4b5a7))   


💸 The US government is getting dangerously close to not being able to pay its damn bills on time, and that's bad news for Wall Street and the global financial system.

📉 If the US government defaults on its Treasury bonds, it could totally screw up the multi-trillion dollar markets that keep everything running smoothly.

💪 The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Sifma) has been busting its ass for over a decade, trying to come up with a plan to avoid a catastrophic blow to the financial markets like we saw back in 2011.

🤔 So, what's gonna happen if Congress doesn't raise the debt limit in time? Well, Sifma says the Treasury might have to delay repaying bondholders and screw with their interest payments. And that's gonna piss off a lot of investors.

🤷‍♂️ You've got money-market funds, banks, and companies all investing in Treasurys to manage their cash. Plus, tons of regular folks have been buying up government debt, especially short-term T-bills. But if a deal isn't reached, those poor suckers might not get their money back for who knows how long!

📅 Sifma expects the Treasury to take it day by day, announcing plans to extend the life of bonds that are supposed to mature on the day before. It's all about keeping the show going, you know?

💥 But here's the thing, if the Treasury messes up and a bond matures without getting paid, it's gonna cause chaos in the Fedwire system. That could freeze billions of dollars in assets overnight and seriously make people question if the US government has any credibility left.

🤯 This debt-ceiling mess could have all sorts of crazy consequences. It might trigger a full-blown financial crisis and who knows what else. The SEC chair is warning that those hedge fund guys have been borrowing like crazy in the Treasury market, and that's a risk to all of us regular folks.

⚠️ Remember back in 2011 when S&P downgraded the US credit rating? Well, analysts are worried that more downgrades could happen, and that would seriously shake confidence in the US government. Wall Street would feel the pain, and the government and taxpayers might end up paying more in interest.

💰 The US Treasury's cash on hand isn't looking too great. They've got an account at the Fed called the Treasury General Account, but it's almost $900 billion lighter than last year. Not a good sign.

📉 This debt-ceiling crap is already messing with the bond market. The Treasury has been issuing fewer short-term Treasury bills, which screwed up trading and caused crazy fluctuations in rates. People are flocking to safe assets like Treasurys, expecting them to rally big time.

 Wall Street and the global financial system are on the edge of a freaking cliff.  Ditched my NVDA and AMD holdings on Thursday and made some sweet tendies. It's time to GTFO before this shit show gets real. You better do the same, my fellow degenerates! 💸🚀Introduction:
The story of NVIDIA (NVDA) is a fascinating journey that showcases the meteoric rise of a technology company and the role of retail investors in shaping its narrative. This one-page paper delves into the ape story of NVIDIA, exploring the company's growth, the emergence of a passionate investor community, and the profound impact it had on the stock's trajectory.

The Rise of NVIDIA:
NVIDIA, a leading semiconductor company known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), has become synonymous with cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming. Over the years, the company's innovative products and strategic acquisitions propelled it to the forefront of the tech industry, driving remarkable financial success.

These individual investors, united by social media platforms and online forums, recognized the potential of NVIDIA's growth prospects and began actively investing in its stock.

The Power of Retail Investors:
The ape community's enthusiasm and belief in NVIDIA's long-term potential played a significant role in driving the stock price higher. Their collective action created a groundswell of demand for NVDA shares, resulting in a surge in its valuation. Through online forums, social media campaigns, and word-of-mouth, retail investors effectively amplified the company's growth story and attracted the attention of institutional investors.

Market Recognition and Institutional Influence:
As the stock price continued its upward trajectory, institutional investors took notice of NVIDIA's remarkable performance and its pivotal role in emerging technologies. This recognition further accelerated the stock's ascent, as more traditional investors joined the ranks of the ape community, further solidifying the company's position as a tech stock triumph.

Reflection and Future Prospects:
The ape story of NVIDIA highlights the evolving landscape of retail investing and the collective power of individual investors. It underscores the growing influence of social media and online communities in shaping investment trends and stock market dynamics. The tale also raises questions about the balance of power between institutional and retail investors and the democratization of investing opportunities.

Conclusion:
The ape story of NVIDIA exemplifies the impact of passionate retail investors in driving the success of a tech giant. The collective belief and enthusiasm of the ape community played a crucial role in elevating NVIDIA's stock to unprecedented heights, while also shedding light on the evolving dynamics of the financial markets. As retail investors continue to play a more significant role in shaping investment trends, the story of NVIDIA serves as a testament to the power of community-driven investing and its potential to reshape the future of the stock market.Bought 20 ADBE calls on May 12th for $2.95 each.  390 strike expiring in July.

Just sold all of them this morning for $33.30.

Bought on technicals and wasn't wrong, it bounced into the stratosphere as planned.  Good company, still undervalued.  I plan to buy back in before ER on June 15th.

For the mouth breathers ... I bought them for $5900, and sold them for $66,600.PLTR was expected to see a reversal after the earnings report. A lot of people bought in and took profits after earnings with an expectation the stock wouldn't be able to hold above $10.00. The stock is now about to close the week above the $13.00 price point, which will signal a shit ton of people to come back into this stock. We already saw Cathie come back in, and with this debt ceiling thing coming up (which will be resolved and will be a catalyst) you're going to see PLTR fucking explode.

With the company already telling people it's going to be GAAP profitable for the rest of 2023 AND the fact they have no debt AND the fact they were able to expand one of the most expensive SaaS products in the world during 2 quarters that were fucking shit for SaaS sales, I think the elevating factors far outweigh the negative ones.

My current positions are LEAPs for 2025.

Although if it goes to 15 I'm probably going to sell out like a bitch and miss gains like I always do.

Fingers crossed.I think Intel is a generational buying opportunity.

Why?

While most believe it to be a boomer stock with shit fundies, they are missing the bigger picture.

1) Process Nodes - Intel got fat and happy. They let the Taiwanese surpass them using technology that Intel itself was a primary player in developing/funding (EUV machines via ASML). Intel has recently hired a new CEO that while on the surface seems brain dead, is actually a legendary engineer who has Intel on the path to take back leadership in process nodes with 18A. Essentially, they will likely have the fastest/most energy efficient chips in the world in 2024 or 2025.

2) AI - A lot of mouth breathers out there believe that Nvidia will be the only player in AI. They don’t understand that Intel will be a major player as well. Not only because the CPU still plays a role, but because Intel is finishing a supercomputer capable of training an AI model with a trillion parameters (way bigger than chat gpt). Their GPU hardware is legit and their most recent data center max is outperforming the Nvidia flagship H100 by 30% across many workloads. 

3) Gaming - Gamers hate Nvidia for constantly raising prices while giving shittier performance per $. Intel ARC GPUs will erode market share in a big way over time. I expect the next model, battlemage, to take significant share from Nvidia as the performance per $ will be unbelievable. 

4) Foundry services - Intel is the only leading edge chip manufacturer in the West. As tensions continue to heat up over Taiwan, more and more companies will have Intel manufacturing their designs at fabs in the US. Intel will likely surpass Samsung as the #2 fab in the world by 2030.

5) Western Governments - Fabs are the next oil and Intel is the only game in town for the west when it comes to bleeding edge. I expect the majority of the chips act to go to Intel. Same with the European chips bill. These bills won’t be one offs either. Intel has a monopoly on Western leading edge chips and will get all of the government contracts, grants, funding, etc associated with that.

6) Taiwan - If something happens in Taiwan, even a simple blockade, I would expect the majority of fabless producers (Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, etc) to come running to Intel. If things get heated between the US and China, the US could ensure that all chips for important industries (healthcare, banking, etc) be manufactured in the United States.

These are just the top six reasons why Intel is generationally cheap. 

I would load up on 2025 leaps and keep rolling them back.YOLO’d my entire cash stack in to ALCC. Reason being is ALCC is a SPAC so has a floor of 10.2x (until the redemption meeting) which is very limited downside considering its trading at $10.63. Also, ALCC’s CEO is Sam Altman who is the hottest name in AI right now as he’s the CEO and founder of OpenAI.For those of you hiding in a box, the debt limit is a dumb law that Congress kind of passed accidentally when they consolidated the federal budget into a single thing.

So now, in our dumb laws, there are two spending limits. The first is the budget of Congress sets, and then there is the maximum amount of debt that the US is allowed to incur. Since Congress has already voted to spend more money than we have, we are running up against the debt limit. This is literally just a thing to authorize us to spend the money that we already agreed to spend. It is very dumb.

Okay, we got out of the way, how do we make money off of this dumb thing?

The closer we get to failing to raise the debt limit the crazier the stock market gets. High volatility is hard to bet on either way because you have to get the direction right, but volatility itself is pretty easy to bet on. You just buy calls for VIX. It tracks stock market volatility. If you had bought it just as the covid pandemic was starting in December 2019 you would have made an ass load of money. 

Ideally, you want these calls dated sometime in mid-june so that you can sell them during the last minute negotiations when the debt limit will almost have been hit but not quite have been hit. The vix almost certainly dropped down much lower once Congress gets back together and raises the debt limit. You might even want to save some of the calls and see if we smash through the debt limit, in which case they will probably become even more valuable. I would guess there's only a 25% chance that we actually default on debt so the safer play is to sell them when they're high.

Other alternatives, especially if you are just hoping to ride the wave of a herd mentality, is to jump into a gold ETF like ishares whatever. This will likely spike at some point, but hasn't moved much yet so who knows? 

Those are my two plays, I'm curious what the rest of you are thinking to hedge against this or make money off of it.Seeing all the $NDVA gains and losses has me thinking... As AI stocks heat up and earnings season comes to an end we still have $AI confirmed to report on Wednesday of next week. Looking at their earnings history they have consistently beat expectations again and again.

In March 2021's report we see earnings of (0.13) and revenue at 49.10M

In March 2021's report we see earnings of (0.06) and revenue at 66.66M

YOY increases in earnings over 100%

YOY increases in revenue over 30%

So.... 

So..... Who is watching $AI for Wednesday's plays?Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.**Come hang out with us on the NEW WallStreetBets[](https://twitter.com/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR) [Discord](https://discord.gg/wsbverse)!**

Check out our [Earnings Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13m2tfd/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/) and [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/contentguide).🚀🚀🚀 Fellow astronauts, let's take a moment to appreciate the wonder that is Nvidia (NVDA), the powerhouse that's been soaring higher than a SpaceX Starship and shows no signs of slowing down. Let's look at some recent news and why we should keep our diamond hands ready.

Nvidia had an absolute barnburner of a year in 2023. The share price has more than doubled, with the company's market valuation hitting an astronomical $940bn (£760bn). After a fantastic early trading session that saw the share price rise by 25%, the stock topped out at $385.84 a share. Nvidia is riding the wave of AI demand, specifically for generative AI products like ChatGPT, which require massive data centers packed with their semiconductor chips.

Nvidia recently reported Q2 revenues of $7.2bn, smashing Wall Street's predictions by 10%. The company also made an ambitious forecast of $11bn in revenues for Q3, which is more than 50% higher than Wall Street's estimate of $7.2bn. Matt Bryson from Wedbush Securities said Nvidia "absolutely blew away prior expectations”.

Mark Lipacis from Jefferies bank believes that Nvidia’s growing data centre revenues could even surpass the combined sales of central processing units from Intel and AMD, two of the stalwart chipmaker.

But it's not just about the numbers; it's about the future. Nvidia is at the forefront of AI, the big trend that everyone and their grandmother wants to get into. Companies are scrambling to integrate AI into their businesses, and that's a goldmine for Nvidia. They make the hardware needed to run the complex AI models, and they're ramping up their supply to meet the surging demand.

However, with all great opportunities come challenges. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has voiced concerns over trade restrictions that could cause "enormous damage." The geopolitics of the US and China are increasingly affecting chip companies, but Nvidia is still going strong.

In summary, Nvidia's booming business and its strategic position in the rapidly growing AI market make it a stock worth watching for all of us here at Wallstreetbets. Keep in mind that the rocket ride might have its bumps due to geopolitical factors, but as we know, that's all part of the journey to the moon.

P.S -this isn't financial advice. 🚀🚀🚀

P.P.S. - "Stonks only go up" is an investment strategyI am 21 and started getting back into trading with about 100$ since school ended. I figured I would yolo into $NVDA with all the AI and what not. Bought a May 26th exp. 375 call and a May 26th exp. 352.5 call… was not disappointed. 

I went from being down 3k all time to being up 2k overnight… looks like I’ll finally have to pay taxes this year on my Stock exchanges.If you want the easiest way to make money off of what I'm saying, I made it as simple as possible for stupid fucking Apes.

You fucking monkeys don't know shit. You're all too scared of your god damned shadows because this world has eaten you up and spit you out. You got one fucking win on Shitadel two years ago and you've been mowed down trying to relive that glory. You all remind me of those fucking apes in 2001 too afraid to step forward and transcend by touching the monolith  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHWs3c3YNs4 . But this ape, /u/ShittyStockPicker ain't afraid to take a fucking risk. 

I’ve been hearing about the impending recession since covid started, I’ve been hearing about the collapse of the dollar since 1990. The internet is full of bears who want to see America punished for its imagined sins: greed, debt, laziness. Why, if you listened to those fucking bears who hate this country and want to see it fail you'd think America was two Oompa Loompas away from being sung a demeaning song about why it fucked up and dragged off the world stage.   
But I'm not one of those America haters. I'm like Warren Buffet, I never fucking bet against America. Ever. 

The hard pill for America haters to swallow is that we are the best god damned system on the planet bar none. The culture we have built worships talent and those stupid enough to risk everything for a dream.  And we don't give a flying fuck if you're a queer dragon-kintyped non-binary star planet. If you're stupid enough to try the impossible, we're going to fucking cheer you on. And when you achieve the impossible, we're going to fucking reward you with it by both worshiping you as a fucking god and more wealth than you know what to do with.   


It's not that way in any other system. You won't find that in Europe, you're not going to find it in India. Don't even think about trying to find that in China.   
If you have a fucking crazy, insane longshot idea that just might fucking work the only people stupid enough to try live here. And its because if you're not descended from people who were told by their countrymen, "Hey, Gus, just shut the fuck up about going to the moon already and eat your fucking gruel." You said, "fuck it, I'm going to America and studying engineering until I can build the biggest ass ladder I can possibly build!"   
And that's still the America I believe in. And I believe that's the America /r/WallStreetBets believes in.   
So is it any fucking surprise then, that once again the United States is at the forefront of yet another technological revolution that is going to profoundly transform global society, rearrange international power structures, and change everything? 

I've been struggling to explain what AI means to people. But here's my best shot, dumb fucks probably want to skip to the end for the TLDR: ***The Information Technology boom introduced sharing of information at 0 marginal cost. The AI boom is different from the Information Technology boom because it is the beginning of the generation of new information at 0 marginal cost.***   
***Information Age: Sharing information at 0 marginal cost***  

***AI Age: Generation of new information at 0 marginal cost***  

Let that fucking sink in. *Generation of information at 0 marginal cost from newspapers to rocket designs.*  

I don't know if you had the chance to listen to the $NVDA conference call, but holy shit I fucking creamed myself rubbing my dick to it. There's nothing that gets me off harder than Capitalism Erotica. 

What the $NVDA call revealed is that corporate America is scrambling to build systems that utilize AI to keep their businesses competitive. There is no reluctance to adopt AI the same way there was reluctance to adopt IT technology 20 years ago. That's going to make adoption of AI happen fucking fast!

Many current CEO's remember companies going bust, or losing market share to a rival who was faster to adopt groundbreaking technology. *The lesson they learned was that it is deadly to shrug off changes in technology.*

The first wave of the AI boom is in stocks like $NVDA. Demand for their chips is going to be insane. The next wave, we'll see this show up in six to twelve months or so, is going to be the companies who adopted AI early and found obvious and unexpected ways to take advantage of 0 marginal cost information generation. ***The moment a company who adopted AI reports that an AI technology led to a blowout quarter we're going to see an explosion in stock prices and unimaginable GDP growth.*** 

We’re not going into recession, we’re on the brink of pushing the world into an unprecedented era of GDP growth and exponential growth in the rate of improvement of living standards.

We’re months away from new all time highs on the Nasdaq. The American economy is about to rip the world’s face off with a GDP rally the likes of which the world had never seen. 

TLDR: HAHAHAHAHA BERSSSSS R FUKKKKKKKK

 0xAdaADaF4Ea724530954835ddE3D0065a71e948e0I'm gonna pack this down to a simple concept - "Money prices." I'm gonna skip trying to mansplain what (I think) money prices are, but in a nutshell, think of dark pool trades that occur at a price that differs from where spot is trading (or, where it HAS traded). 

For example, 

Date     Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description

05/25 | QQQ  | 12:56:00 | 339.98 | 0.24  | \*BULL.TA\_HOD |  $ PRICE ($340.57) TA > HOD (340.32)

TA = "Trading above." Since this post won't have any charts/pictures to put everything more into perspective,, I recommend pulling up a chart if you wana follow along. If there's one thing I've learned over the past few years, it's that "money prices" fill; always. We're 19 (trading) days into May, and so far, there's been 52 TA > HOD (money prices that hit ABOVE spot price HOD) for $QQQ. Although these prices <always> fill, it's not always as easy as today where you can nail a .17% move in 20 minutes. QQQ has always been the golden child of money prices (in terms of time-taken-to-fill). There are absolutely circumstances (if money price > ATH, 52wk low, or shows BIG % move > .35%) where 'filling' a money price, doesn't happen within the hour, day, or week. Another example being today where QQQ hit $338.86 -- from Monday (after having sold off almost -1.75% from that point), or SPY hitting lows -2% since last Friday after seeing $422.69. 

&#x200B;

Date     Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description

05/22 | QQQ | 15:59:00 | 337.64 | 0.41 | \*BULL.TA\_HOD | $ PRICE ($338.86) TA > HOD (338.67)      

or 

05/19 | SPY | 10:29:00 | 420.59 | 0.1 | \*BULL.TA\_HOD | $ PRICE ($422.69) TA > HOD (420.72)   

&#x200B;

There are 2 golden rules to money prices. 1. They always fill. 2. Even under the most extreme circumstances (esp SPY/QQQ), I've never seen it take longer than 3 months for one to fill. Now, in 2022, things got... I'm not even sure the word. But, now is when I'd really pull up a chart to follow along.  

&#x200B;

Date               Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description

05/24/2022 | QQQ | 15:59:00 | 329.60 | 3.22 | \*BULL.TA\_HOD | $ PRICE ($330.85) TA > HOD (330.29)

06/02/2022 | SPY | 11:48:00 | 412.74 | 0.81 | \*BULL.TA\_HOD | $ PRICE ($412.96) TA > HOD (412.86)  

06/02/2022 | SPY | 15:59:00 | 417.39 | 1.95 | \*BULL.TA\_HOD | $ PRICE ($418.35) TA > HOD (417.44)

Where were we 3 months later, in August of 2022? This was the first time I've ever seen regular TA prices (where, they're NOT above a stock's ATH. Just above HOD/Weekly high) that it's taken this amount of time. Nonetheless, 3 months. If you haven't noticed, this type of arbitrage is typically somewhere around a .15% - .35% move to where spot price is trading. Even a .30% move is on the more-extreme side. But like I said, 2022 got..... idk the word. These next instances are 07/22/2022 - don't mean to spam the length of this, but to clarify the fact that these prices aren't gimmicks, imagine seeing back2back2back2back money prices claiming that next .15% move lower -- 

........................................and then nuking it -14%.

First of all..... FOURTEEN f\*\*\* percent???? I've never seen anything like it - not even close. Not even semi-close to a fraction. Nowhere near that. And TWICE? TWO OF THEM? WTF? Again..... if you're a good noodle, and you have a chart open of $QQQ, tell me: where were we within the next 3 months? Over the past 4 years, I can count on 1 hand the # of times I've seen it take > 1 month for something to fill, so 2022 has really made me speculate whether those types of instances could be tied to option expiration? Quarterlies? Just straight up unusual/extreme instances? I wish I knew, but I don't. Regardless, I've been doing this long enough to understand just how near & dear money prices are to the market. Even if time is a negating factor, it doesn't stand in the way for long. That being said, lets get to the kicker.

In June of 2022, a $340.21 money price hit for $SPY. Nearly -7%. Again, I'm floored seeing one that extreme. F\*\*\* outside THE REALM of extreme.

We're now, 1 month away to the 1 year mark of seeing that. Not only did SPY (unlike $QQQ) NOT fill that extreme 52wk low, but we're +11% since, and 17% away from $340.21. Maybe, just MAYBE................. maybe, that has to be a gimmick? MAYBE? For the first time EVER? Because if THAT was a gimmick, maybe this one is too?

Nobody calls for a 1987 type crash. Even if they did - they'd be crazy. I'd call them crazy. Am I calling for a 1987 type crash? No. I'm just saying, it's not off the table. It's not off the table at all. As of right now, $SPY has $422.69 to fill, & $QQQ has $341.42. The market will go higher (I'm edumucated guessing + hoping) those get touched so our T's get crossed & our i's dotted. There's no crash flashy enough that isn't warranted for SPY + QQQ to break the lows we made late last year. The closer we get to 06/16/2023, the more I'm anticipating the unthinkable.I have a question, I really didn’t see any huge Bid size on multiple brokerages for calls. Like some were 5-30 contracts. The bigger sizes were the closer to $300-$330 but even those weren’t heavily volumed. Was all of them closed at open like really quick. But I checked literally at open, no way thousands of contracts were all sold at open. 

Please someone explain cause I have seen stocks go up yet calls didn’t sell cause there was no bidding.Small earnings play on a move that I didn’t think would happen. Lost 8k on some short term puts which I thought for sure was the move after seeing a congress member buy 5.5 million of out of the money puts just prior to me purchasing this.**The Fed**

Initial jobless claims at 229k vs. 245k est. & 225k prior (rev down from 242k); continuing claims at 1.794M vs. 1.8M est. & 1.799M prior. No sign of labor market weakness yet.

**The Economy**

Germany officially entered a recession in Q1 2023, as the GDP was revised lower to -0.3%, following a 0.5% decline in Q4 2022. A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Interestingly, despite the recession, the DAX reached an all-time high last week.

The Bloomberg Economic Surprise Index is currently at its highest level in over a year. This indicates that economic data releases have been surpassing market expectations. As a result, the expectation of a recession keeps getting pushed back.

So many diverging signals this year. Here is another one: 10-year yield suggests booming growth, while the copper/gold ratio indicates a potential recession.

**The Business**

JPM, says stocks' risk-reward is 'poor,' recommends adding to cash and gold holdings.

BoA: “While a potential recession in 2H (house view) could put some pressure on the consensus 2H earnings recovery, we believe the downside risk will be mitigated given companies’ cost cuts. ..

This AI frenzy reminds me of the "cloud" trend from 2015 to 2018, and even 2019 before the COVID crash. The "cloud kings" (if anyone still remembers) experienced significant returns due to the real growth in cloud services and the widespread adoption of cloud technology. AI may very well be the next big thing. However, the risk is real too, as it could follow a similar path to the overheated dot com bubble or the underwhelming performance of the AR/VR Multiverse. Valuation aside, I am inclined to believe AI is here to stay and the potential is huge, as it is being adopted very broadly very quickly across various industries. What do you think?Hey guys I was reading over some company filings as earnings season is in effect and I had an accounting question.

Free cash flow is typically found by just taking the operating cash flow and subtracting the general expenses (CAPEX) following all operation activity. However, stock based compensation gets included into operating cash flow activities and therefore adds to the free cash flow total.

This led me to wonder if I should subtract the stock based compensation from the total cash flow as stock based compensation is actually just a non-cash expense of the business and does dilute existing shareholders. This is shockingly significant however as many newer and mostly tech companies generate ridiculous amounts of there cash flow from stock based compensation which is extremely deceptive (ex. ADSK, TEAM, PLTR, NVDA, SNOW, CRM)

This led me to ask if it makes sense to subtract stock based compensation from cash flow , include it in cash flow, or something else.

What do you guys think?I say garter belt because that’s what I’m usually wearing when I sink all my savings into intraday SPY puts. 

I am a degenerate gambler. I would be seen and heard if it pleases you. I have advice for all those who would seek to remain regarded. 

Here are my qualifications:

- Gambling on Robinhood since Nov 2014. 
- Lost job late 2019 and put all my savings on SPY puts. Held and held, and by Feb 19, 2020, my $35k life savings was $10k. But I still felt like I was “right” and everyone else would realize the markets were overvalued.
- Pandemic turned that $10k into $160k, but it was never going to be enough. As SPY rocketed from like $218 to $474, lost my ass back down to ~$25k. 
- Gambled since then from time to time, overall down about $10k over the 9 year span, but the ups and downs have been pure trauma. 

I now have a baby on the way and I’m done. Seriously. I’ve sent all my savings (still $25k or so) to my wife. 

I will tell you something, cuck to cuck. If my wife takes all my money and cashes it out and then fucks my best friend on top of it while showing the camera (held by the boss who fired me, his cock in her mouth) a genetic test saying I’m not the father of my child, and then my best friend and ex boss nemesis both cum huge loads on her wedding ring, and as I get the video of all this sent to my text and open it up, the doorbell rings and my best friend ape-waltzes in like Vince McMahon with my wife on his shoulder, and then she holds her ring hand out and says, “lick it off you pathetic little gay bear cuck loser,” that is STILL better than giving my actual earned money away to the hedgies and Vanguard. They have enough money.

Don’t gamble. Invest. Or at least have your gambling monitored by someone with a functioning frontal cortex. And be prepared for the market to run sideways for like the next decade.Many of you were asking for me to post an update on my $NVDA weekly call option profits. Today I sold near open. Could've made about 20k more if timed it perfectly but I have no regrets, I am very happy!! 

I made around 181k (in USD) in profits, and this account went from 38k to around 219k (in USD)

I am now DCA into dividend stocks over the next few weeks, mixed in with some "growth" stocks mixed in that still pay a little dividend. Some of you were asking which dividend stocks I plan to buy, and this is not financial advice and DYOR but they include: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA (very small opening position at this price), JPM, SBUX, KO, PG, and O.

Of these, at today's (May 25, 2023) prices, my fav starting price positions are for SBUX and O (think these are good price for these 2 stocks especially). Again, not financial advice.

Happy to collect dividends from this portfolio going forward!

Then, came the artificial  intelligence frenzy that sent the stock and its big tech peers on a  tear.

The chipmaker has added around $560 billion in market  capitalization since Wood dumped her shares — with the last $200 billion  of that surge coming overnight after the company handily beat earnings.

Although  Wood holds Nvidia across several of her smaller funds, investors in the  flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) have mostly been left out of  this year’s blistering 161.58% rally.

**In February, when Nvidia traded for $234 a share, roughly 50 times forward earnings, Wood said the valuation was “very high.”**

“We  like Nvidia, we think it’s going to be a good stock. It’s priced —it’s  the ‘check-the-box’ AI company,” Wood told CNBC on Feb 27. “For a  flagship fund, where we’ve consolidated towards our highest conviction  names, part of that has to do with valuation.”

A spokesperson for ARK Investment Management said the company doesn’t comment on trading activity. 

Wood has been a long-time fan of Nvidia, but her conviction on the stock has wavered at times.

[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cathie-wood-s-arkk-dumped-nvidia-stock-before-560-billion-surge-1.1925004](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cathie-wood-s-arkk-dumped-nvidia-stock-before-560-billion-surge-1.1925004)This was a brutal day to trade. This felt like a few weeks ago where all the technicals were completely detached. Very tough trading today and honestly the fact that I basically broke even (slightly red day) is impressive as I felt like this was a big L of a day. 

This also reminded me of late 2022 where I would enter a position and almost immediately be down 5-10%... I haven’t seen that happen in a long time. IT was very weird and there were so many times I felt like premiums didn’t make any sense compared to the actual underlying. Frustrating day but a good reminder that we exploit the days that fit our strategy and we just survive the days that don’t without suffering major losses. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

https://preview.redd.it/6z8le3psq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7680f4c2f65344ac291f0ebbf6131825af65ce68

As of right now surprisingly we did not establish a new demand today… we came very close (had we closed over 415 we would have)… so this means 1 of 2 things… first, this means that this was a fake breakout and that we tomorrow will see a massive rejection tomorrow to close at 410.2 or below… OR it means tomorrow we establish a new demand (Support) and we bounce. 

Now when we look at other things like the DMI which did start a wave up (bullish) and momentum still being bullish (not extreme) one would favor a breakout tomorrow to put a new demand in. However, this is anyones game for tomorrow right now. 

From a weekly supply/ demand stand point we are as of now set to make a new 418.59 supply and take out 416.08 supply. We also are holding the support of the 411.46 demand. 

The ideal bear close tomorrow is under 411.46 and the ideal bull close is over 416.08.

Price action wise we did manage to come back up and retake the daily 8ema resistance. The one interesting thing is that we closed a doji. Now this could mean that we reject and push lower tomorrow (would think more of an evening doji star pattern). 

From a price action start point bulls would prefer a close minimally over 417 and bears would prefer a close under 412.4.

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 418.78 -> 419.5  
 Demand- 410.2  
 Support- 414.6 -> 412.4 -> 411   
 Resistance- 417 -> 418.6

From a supply and demand stand point futures also did not put in a new demand here… however, we may see that happen if that moves up overnight. However, we would certainly need a daily close over the 4160 area in order to establish a new one. 

If we do put a new one in our upside target would be 4198. However, if this was a failed breakout/ recovery then our target would be 4127 again tomorrow and eventually 4075. 

From a weekly stand point we are set to put a new supply in at 4200 to take our 4192 supply. We are still bouncing off 4130 demand too. Bears want a close under 4130 and bulls want a closure over 4200. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

On futures bulls failed to retake the daily 8ema here but did retake the daily 20ema. With a downside to upside doji this actually to me looks more bearish in nature and could see us with a sell off overnight and into tomorrow. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that we are going into a 3 day weekend and I believe with no debt ceiling being signed today that they will not be meeting until Tuesday. That could cause markets to want to sell off and be risk off into the long 3 day weekend (friendly reminder markets are closed Monday!).

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4216 -> 4209 -> 4055  
 Demand- 4198 -> 4128  
 Support- 4158 -> 4126 -> 4110  
 Resistance- 4172 -> 4188 -> 4208

**QQQ SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u8gy0jjuq12b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=47dff0613041517124523b2b600c330de0397be3

Now this is where QQQ completely differs from SPY… here you can see we did indeed close out a bullish abandoned baby reversal… in doing so we put in a new 331.35 demand and now we are pushing upwards. 

The one interesting thing here is that we actually in gapping up like this are now seeing a possible bearish abandoned bearish reversal formed too… The daily DMI is waving up which gives further upside favor but if we got a hard rejection or drop tomorrow we actually likely will turn 339.72 into a new supply (resistance) and would look to retest 337.6 and possibly even 331.35 again. 

From a weekly stand point the DMI is very overbought here and we have still not put a new weekly supply in. We have our next major level at 361.85. Bulls would like a closure anywhere over 335-340 and bear ideally need a closure under 330. 

QQQ Daily Levels  
 Supply- 347.11 -> 337.6 -> 326.82  
 Demand- 336.37 -> 331.35 -> 325.99

**VIX**

As I was suspecting the VIX did reject. I was thinking that closure under 20.08 would lead to a downside move on VIX and would also lead to an upside move on SPY. Now one thing here to keep in mind is that 18.86 is a strong support area followed by 17.97. If SPY bears can bounce us off 18.86 tomorrow again then we could look to close over 20.08 to end the week and head into a 3 day weekend. In doing so could see the doji rejection play out here on spy daily.

Honestly the fact that I closed just barely red today blows my mind as I truly felt like the whole day was a massive L. I have some pretty solid concrete rules for entries and exits. Today I just could not find a good entry to save my life. Today was definitely the type of day that if you wait for confirmation you already were too late and bought the top or bottom. There was also the lovely morning where SPY price action completely inversed what VOLD was doing. Honestly my thoughts on a day like today is that when big cap like NVDA is up 25-30% that the internals go completely wack and we are just left with poor technicals to trade. When you step back at the EOD it clearly was a range day today, however, it was not like our usual range days with clear set techncials for entries. 

I also a lot of times found as soon as I entered into a position that the premium almost seemed lagged and would instantly hit me 5-7%... there was a lot of times too where there seemed almost like a 3-5 second delay on price action versus premium. I watched a few solid candle drops on SPY and the put I had qued didn’t move at all and then all of a sudden it would be a $2 pump on premium. 

Tough day to trade but I look forward to a better day tomorrow.TL;DR: Ray Dalio, Founder of Bridgewater Associates, shares his thoughts on the ongoing U.S. debt ceiling debate. His central point is that both increasing and not increasing the debt limit will have disastrous consequences. A smart bipartisan plan that reforms the system and focuses on productivity could prevent a terrible outcome.

Likely Outcome: Dalio predicts that Democrats and Republicans will avoid a long-term default and instead adopt short-term solutions that won't address the core issues. Dalio argues against this approach.

Dalio's Background: Dalio's perspective is shaped by his role as a global macro investor, focusing on five major forces: money/credit/economy, politics, geopolitics, natural events, and learning/technology. For him, political polarization is currently the greatest threat to sound decision-making.

The Political Landscape: According to Dalio, three political "types" exist today: the hard-right, the hard-left, and the bipartisan moderate. Dalio identifies as a bipartisan moderate and warns that extreme polarization will intensify conflicts, possibly leading to a non-violent "civil war".

Risks of Increasing the Debt Limit: If the debt limit is repeatedly raised without restrictions, Dalio sees a potential for a financial collapse. The endless cycle of spending more than one earns and covering it with debt is unsustainable and could lead to a debt crisis.

Risks of Not Increasing the Debt Limit: On the other hand, failing to raise the debt limit could result in default or cutbacks for those least able to afford them, causing financial and social upheaval.

Solution: Dalio believes that a smart bipartisan plan that comprehensively addresses the U.S.'s financial, economic, and national debt issues is necessary. Swiftly settling the debt issue without addressing the root causes is not a sustainable solution.

The Battle: Dalio suggests that the fight between moderates willing to compromise and extremists who aren't needs to happen. It's time for moderate leaders from both parties to band together and challenge the extremes in their parties.

Reforming Capitalism: Dalio also stresses the importance of reforming capitalism to ensure collective earnings exceed spending. He believes productivity - often neglected - is key to improving incomes without reducing living standards. Both political sides should focus on productivity and fair distribution of benefits.

Concluding Thoughts: Dalio insists his views aren't as important as the creation of a smart bipartisan plan by skilled moderates ready to fight extremists. This represents a chance for courageous moderates to band together and act, despite potential political costs.

Remember, this is a summary of Dalio's article, meant to provide you with a quicker read while retaining the core of his argument. For a full understanding of his views, I encourage you to read the [original piece.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-should-done-debt-ceiling-argument-between-democrats-ray-dalio/?published=t)Whistleblower just dumped over 100GB of accident data to German news site

Is there such thing as true value really? Isn't value determined by supply/demand in a marketplace anyways? Can we tell our gf/wives that LV purse she bought was overpriced based on the manufacturing cost? Furthermore, why should any stock be worth more than a penny or its divident? What are we really getting in return? No one surely thinks they really own a part of a company just because once in a while they can vote on something and hope management gives a shit. We're giving them our money so they can grow the company and become rich, but will they share their profits if that happens? Nah. Just a bragging right we "own" a part of the company and hope some other idiot buys this invisible thing from us at a higher price. So how is a stock share any different than say a Pepe coin? Anyways just thinking out loud lol...Overpriced, we heard that before. All the analysts are saying it’s a buy a now. NVIDA will hit 450 by the end of summer. So make sure to load up on shares a calls.

Nothing can take this stock down: not credit card being all time high, no debt ceiling BS, no China ban, no fed rate increase, no pivot, no China war, no Russian war, nothing man.. 

AI is the future . It already took my job from Wendy’s and one day it will take yours too. So might as well go all in. 

I lost a lot of money buying puts, so now it’s time sell one of my kidneys to buy this stock while it so cheap. Time to go all in. It’s AI man! It’s the future !

There won’t be a market crash. Those are the bears 🐻 talking . Go all in boys . You will never regret.Ulta Beauty reports earnings after the closing bell today, and with cosmetics still selling, results should be strong.

Ulta is expected to report first-quarter earnings of $6.89 a share on revenue of $2.62 billion. That’s a jump from the same period last year, when the beauty retailer reported earnings of $6.30 a share on revenue of $2.35 billion.

Shares of Ulta have had a solid run, jumping 37% in the past 12 months and 3% so far this year to trade around $485. The stock’s performance can be attributed to the company’s consistent beat-and-raise quarters, as customers continue to shop for beauty products despite continued uncertainty about the economy’s path.

“Strong consumer demand and outstanding execution by our teams fueled broad-based strength across our business,” Chief Executive David Kimbell said on the company’s last earnings call in March.

And even though several retailers have warned of a slowdown in consumer spending, financial results from the beauty brand E.l.f. could be evidence that Ulta is well-positioned to buck the trend.

E.l.f. Beauty (ELF) on Wednesday posted [robust earnings and revenue that crushed estimates](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/e-l-f-beauty-elf-212503433.html), and provided full-year guidance that far outpaced Wall Street’s expectations. While some retailers like Target (TGT) and Lowe's (LOW) are warning of a buyer slowdown, consumers seem to still want to shop for their favorite beauty products.

"We think its [Ulta’s] comp growth remained strong driven by solid trends in both transactions and ticket growth,” UBS analyst Michael Lasser wrote in a research note on May 11. “While consumers’ interest in makeup products has been picking up, self-care categories continue to perform well too.”

Lasser rates the stock as a Buy with a $640 price target.

Sales of beauty products have historically performed well during economic downturns. This phenomena is known as the “lipstick index,” and refers to the trend where makeup users continue to buy more affordable luxuries, even when their wallets are being pinched.

But there is room for concern. Inflation is still historically high, and there are clear signs that consumers are feeling the pressure. The University of Michigan recently said that May’s preliminary index of consumer sentiment fell to the lowest reading since November 2022.

Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh cut his price target on Ulta stock to $575 from $600 on May 19, but maintained his Outperform rating.

“In contrast to prior quarters, we see limited EPS upside potential amidst an aggressive investment agenda, a slightly more promotional beauty backdrop, and a weakening retail discretionary landscape,” he wrote in a research note at the time.

I think the stock will do very well with earnings, so I'm gonna grab a call spread. The stock moves on average about 8% with earnings, so I'll pick something that has a maximum profitability at an 8% gain. This means getting the 5/26 500c ($1210) and selling the 525c ($550). I can grab the spread for $660, with a max profit of 279% if "all goes well." Lol. Keep in mind tho, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.Held INTC a long time and it didn’t do anything.  In 2016 I decided to trim 1/2 off and diversify into another chip.  Figured NVDA would be a good choice as they were pretty much a gaming graphics play back then.

A little luck apparently never hurts.  The position now dwarfs my account.

I don’t play the options game like most here and typically go long stock only, and hold it a long time.  Boring, but effective on occasion.
This market defies logic.  In particular the S&P as we stand on what most everyone sees as the inevitable - a recession. We keep going up no matter the news.  Banks fail, shrug, up; inflation, shrug, up; debt default, shrug, up; 490 of the S&P 500 down, shrug, up.

With the S&P being driven largely by the top tech stocks if any of them miss or start to slide - will the S&P go through the floor since everything else has already been beaten down and people are looking for an excuse to quantify their fear of downturn?

The Fed IS NOT cutting rates.  They have made ZERO indication that this is even on the table.  WHY. TF. Are people buying into a recession with this crazy idea that rate cuts are coming?

I am mystified.

Edit: no puts. I don’t do options.  Just have dry powder.

Edit 2: I am not even hoping/ calling for a major incredible crash.  Rather - just trying to make sense of this.  This run up amid all of the head wind is non sensical.  I am ok with volatility - but NOT running full speed into something that just screams negativity.Have been hearing a lot about risk related to China/supply chains of late and with the G7 meeting last week am curious about ETFs to limit this risk. 

Seems like there are alot of EM funds that omit China exposure but was hoping more to find something that will do well if China becomes less of a player globally to be offensive on this potential trend 

  
https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/22/g-7-leaders-de-risk-china.htmlI have a few accounts where I had dozens of 355 calls, I have sold most but not all when I sell them all I’ll post final gains but point is, people think they need to start with thousands.. just to blow. Smart regarded trading with just 300$ works haha.Costco (COST) is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter results today, May 25. 

Analysts estimate that Costco Wholesale will report earnings of $3.29 per share compared to earnings of $3.04 per share from the same quarter last year. They are also expecting the company to report $54.53 billion, an increase of 3.68% over the prior year quarter. As well as a profit of $14.40 per share this year. A year earlier, the company earned $13.14 per share.

I expect Costco to likely beat the revenue and earnings expectations. It is worth pointing out that despite the pandemic and inflation, the business has managed to grow strongly. Consumers loaded up on essentials in high quantities to keep costs low. However, Costco’s March 2023 sales data pointed to a potential slowdown for the business - with total comparable sales down 1.1% year-over-year (y-o-y), and e-commerce down 12.7% y-o-y. This marks the first time in multiple years that comps declined for the company, largely driven by rampant inflation. However, things improved a little in the April 2023 sales report - which saw its total comparable sales grow only slightly to 1.4%, and e-commerce was down 5.9%. Now that the company’s monthly sales growth looks slow, investors might need to brace for potentially softer quarters ahead. The recent decline might be alarming but Costco makes a majority of its profits from its membership income, so comparable sales growth isn’t as important for it as it is for other retailers. The monthly reports do not include any information on Costco’s profitability or segment and membership revenue breakup.

**Revenues expected to be slightly ahead of consensus estimates**

[Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/) estimates COST’s FQ3 2023 revenues to be $55.1 Billion, marginally higher than the consensus estimate mentioned earlier. In Q2, Costco’s membership fee income was 6.2% higher than the prior-year period. And the renewal rate remained strong, at 92.6% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide. Even as degenerate gamblers, we need to keep an eye on this metric when calculating Costco’s long-term growth potential. Also, Costco currently boasts nearly $14 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Its long-term debt is only $6.5 billion, so Costco has a net cash position on its balance sheet. For the full-year 2023, we expect [Costco’s Revenues](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/COST/no-login-required/VPSnY8ac/Costco-Revenues-How-Does-COST-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230525) to grow 8% y-o-y to $245 billion.

Costco is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for COST in this report.

**EPS likely to match consensus estimates**

COST’s FQ3 2023 earnings per share is expected to be $3.30 per Trefis analysis, almost matching the consensus estimate. In the second quarter, Costco’s earnings per share rose from $2.92 (last year), despite supply chain pressure.

A membership fee increase is unlikely this year because of high inflation, but it will happen sooner rather than later. Costco generally raises its membership fees every five years, last raised in 2017. This should help the company boost its bottom line further.

**A membership fee increase may be coming**

Another potential catalyst that could increase COST shares is a membership fee increase. In the note, UBS Analyst Michael Lasser said now is the right time to raise fees, despite consumer wallets' being stretched. "This will be a key focus this quarter. We think there's a good chance that COST will bump its Gold Star Membership fee by $5 and its Executive Membership fee by $10 either this quarter or next."

Last quarter, membership fees brought in $1.03 billion, which is an 6.2% y-o-y increase as mentioned earlier. Costco last raised membership prices — a Costco Gold Star membership costs $60 per year and an Executive Membership goes for $120 — in June 2017. The company typically raises prices every 5 years and seven months on average, which suggests the next hike is imminent.

**What to do for earnings?**

Due to high strike prices, calls on this stock is kinda expensive. So I'm going to go for a call spread. The company has moved on average about ±4% with earnings, so I'll go for something that it's max profit at a 4% gain. This means buying the 5/26 490c for $510 and selling the 5/26 502.5c for $240. I can get the spread for $270 with a max gain of 4.6x if this goes my way (lol).Through all this, both skepticism and cynicism have blinded me to nvidia a share price approaching previous ATH. While I was busy decrying executives desire to employ AI in place of creatives and drive the final nail in the coffin that is arts and creative work as a source of reliable livable income, the obsession with ChatGPT as if it’s some sentient all knowing oracle and not just the mosaic plagiarism machine it is, and the obsession with literally saying everything is or has AI…

I never once thought, “hey, you do like nvidia products and the company. Why not buy up some of those shares you let go of early last year. You know you got a nice pump from nvidia in December 2021. Maybe it’s time to at least play them long again.”[Option Summary](https://preview.redd.it/0ugpjq3dyz1b1.png?width=3180&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=74fa8f82f146cc7b662e23c6e73bf46f54d7b66c)

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-26.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean "cheaper." High numbers mean "expensive." A 1 means "fairly" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have "weeklies", the underlying is "too cheap", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.
* **How should this be improved?** Do you have any suggestions or notice any bugs with this report?**Picture  IBM. Yeah, I'm talking about that old-as-dirt tech behemoth your  grandma's boyfriend probably worships. The same one that brought us  colossal mainframe computers in the 60s, somehow didn't see the PC  revolution coming in the 80s, and took a while to hop onto the cloud in  the 2000s. Yep, that IBM. Well, buckle up, because the dinosaur's got a  new trick, and it's called AI & no-one is paying attention.**

**If  you haven’t been paying attention, IBM’s been making changes over the  past few years.  Its fairly new CEO (Arvin something) has jettisoned the  shitty parts of IBM and was integral to bringing RED HAT into the fold.   In addition to that, IBM has partnered with “disrupters” like  Palantir, uIpath and more to offer those disruptive technologies in its  products through the army of consultants on the dole.  Our Boy Arvin was  preaching real AI (not the old Watson BS) before it was cool.  He  stated on his day 1, it would be IBM’s MAIN FOCUS!**

**So,  AI is about to make IBM's product suite hotter than the action at  Wendy’s on a Friday night. We're talking automatic deployment and  configuration, making the very popular, but currently too damn difficult  to implement Red Hat OpenShift as accessible and easy to deploy as your  boyfriend’s weiner into your wife. Lowering the barrier for AI  adoption? Check. Simplifying complex processes? Double check. Boosting  customer loyalty and demand like a young version of the great Tina  Turner (RIP)? You bet.**

**And  it's not just the products. IBM's about to make it rain with consulting  services too. Imagine a world where AI is integrated everywhere. Sounds  cool, right? But also, like, really freaking complicated. That's where  IBM swaggers in, flexing its consulting muscle, ready to save the day.  While your cousin’s boyfriend (you) might consider IBM a tech dinosaur,  big enterprises see it differently. To them, IBM is the reliable  old-timer that knows a thing or two about pioneering in AI.**

**In  the wild world of AI, where enterprises are about to outspend consumers  like a WSB member after a big 0 DTE play, IBM is positioned  to rake in some serious tendies. IBM versus Accenture in AI consulting?  It's like choosing between a moon landing and a backyard rocket  experiment.**

**But  it doesn't stop there. IBM is also on the cusp of injecting AI steroids  into its operational processes. Think AI-driven automation, predictive  insights, and enhanced security protocols. Basically, it's like IBM is  about to put its operations on an Elon hyperloop towards  efficiency and cost savings.**

**So,  the next time you're thinking about IBM, remember this: It's not just  your grandma's boyfriend’s tech company anymore. This sleeping giant is  waking up to the sound of AI's alarm clock, and it's ready to seize the  day. As the AI revolution rolls on, IBM is sitting pretty, ready to  become the biggest beneficiary in the enterprise space, while  simultaneously shaping our digital future. So, keep an eye on this  old-timer, because IBM is poised to do what it does best: surprise us  all.**Thanks nvda, splunk, elf, ulta.

Added a couple of naked calls in IRA and 4 spreads in individual account. Maybe should’ve gone full regard and all in. 

This year has been good, thanks to lyft puts, smci calls, uber calls and now these. 

NVDA 🚀🚀🚀I have no idea what to do with the money. I've never had something like this happen to me, can someone suggest what I should do now? Also how should I deal with the tax situation?TLDR: me no like dollar store. me short dollar store company. also ai is the future. 

Here are some more-likely-true-than-not assumptions:

1. AI is the future. because AI duh. 
2. Dollar stores are not the future (who buys 6 eggs for $3 when you can buy a dozen for the same price 🫠)
3. i don’t like dollar stores. 

who am i to say these assumptions are correct in the first place? 🙃 nonetheless based on these assumptions DLTR is more worthy of shorting than NVDA/AMD/AAPL etc etc. 

*(BAD) FINANCIAL ADVICE AKA NOT GOOD FINANCIAL ADVICE AKA DONT FOLLOW THIS*What are your thoughts on Planet Fitness - PLNT? Their May 4, 2023, Quarterly Report stated they have 18.1 million members across 2446 stores. That’s about 7339 members per gym location. The Planet Fitness gyms near me have a max capacity of 360. How the heck can they get 7400 people in these locations. What am I missing here?

Our Planet Fitness location just got all new MATRIX equipment after a major $1M renovation.  It looks like they are trying to cater to the Black Card memberships by expanding the massage chairs area, and tanning booth area.  No classrooms were added during the build out, empty floor space (floor mat routines) has been taken out.  Chatter amongst members indicate that the screens don't allow them to do their normal workouts, or limit what types of workouts can be done.  The MATRIX tech stated that Planet Fitness bought the lowest level screens available, and quipped, "what do you expect for $10 month."  

With 18.1 million members at $10/month that's $181million gross per month.  How can a company as large as Planet Fitness not be able to negotiate better screens/software on the bulk purchases?  Are their numbers really not that great as RBC states?

Are the franchisees being forced to upgrade per Franchise agreements and to their detriment, thus artificially increasing Planet Fitness equipment purchase numbers that they tout in their filings.  Is Planet Fitness selling bare bones equipment with high markups?

Congress is considering legislation to make it easier to end gym memberships and force physical/in person renewals instead of automatic renewals. Many gyms require you to cancel membership or face (predatory) automatic renewal. Is this how Planet Fitness has so many members? What will this mean to their bottom line? RBC has upgraded theme, I think they’re overhyped and I don’t see growth or membership numbers that they’re touting if they’re relying on predatory default memberships.

Based on my first-hand experience, I don't trust their numbers.  What the heck am I missing giving a high-end RBC price target of $115?  Should we expect in a year or two from now that they will have to restate their numbers?

Fairness FYI - I have memberships in Planet Fitness and One Life Fitness (business travel), and own PLNT in my portfolio.I have been betting AI all year round. Just sold everything today and locked in 127k profits today on 48k call options. Intrinsically they value more but no one else is buying them. Fuck the MM

Expect to make $10k more while market settle out.With nvda’s earnings being $4.36 annualized their new p/e is under $100 currently. It was just previously 150+. Amd has a p/e of over 600.

Took out a $6,000 Cash Advance on my Credit Card yesterday and averaged down. Absolutely regarded markethttps://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/bill-ackman-says-icahn-somewhat-205128986.html

Pershing Square founder Bill Ackman has warned that his investment firm’s rival, Icahn Enterprises, could prove to be another Archegos, a hedge fund whose spectacular 2021 implosion caused losses of over $10 billion for Wall Street banks.

In early May, Hindenburg Research accused the holding company and its famous controlling owner, Carl Icahn, of employing “Ponzi-like” economics by paying off existing retail investors with unsustainably large dividends funded by new investors buying its stock exchange-listed depositary units.


Ever since the allegations were leveled by Hindenburg, which stated from the outset it was selling Icahn Enterprises short in a bet its price would fall, the holding has shed half its market value and is now worth $8.9 billion—less than Ackman’s $10 billion Pershing Square.

On Wednesday, the Pershing Square billionaire said he was “fascinated” by the accusations and in particular the discovery of personal loans taken out by Icahn and secured against the depositary units in his eponymous investment holding, since it could prove highly unstable.

This, he said, “reminds me somewhat of Archegos”, where Wall Street’s prime brokers were left in the dark about just how much money their over-leveraged client was borrowing around town. 


“If Icahn were to sell any shares, the stock would likely drop precipitously as the overhang of additional sales and the further resulting loss in confidence would catalyze other shareholders to exit before the deluge,” Ackman wrote.



Bill Hwang’s Archegos family office collapsed like a house of cards two years ago, resulting in numerous banks losing money, most notably Credit Suisse. The Zürich lender, caught holding the proverbial bag, suffered a $5.5 billion hit that helped cement its status as Europe’s worst-managed bank and proved a key contributor to its ultimate downfall in March. 


Hwang is now being prosecuted for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which warned that even a single hedge fund like Archegos “can have far-reaching implications for investors” given enough banks willing to lend it money for speculation.

Icahn Enterprises could not immediately be reached by Fortune for comment.

Ackman said he was neither long nor short on Icahn Enterprises, but merely was watching with interest from the sidelines how Icahn’s precariously financed margin loans would play out.


“All it takes is for one lender to break ranks and liquidate shares or attempt to hedge, before the house comes falling down,” he wrote. “The patsy is the last lender to liquidate.”

Icahn blames Federal Reserve’s QE for his failed bets

On May 10, Icahn Enterprises reported it swung to a quarterly net loss of $270 million from a profit of $323 million a year earlier amid a negative return of 4.1%.

Despite the poor Q1 performance, the sharp drop in the price of its depositary units and, most importantly, Hindenburg’s allegations of impropriety, CEO David Willets ended the investor call after just 12 minutes following his team’s scripted remarks. “Apparently there are no questions, we thank you for your time,” he said.


Hindenburg went on the attack once more the following day after filings revealed that Icahn had now pledged nearly 203 million units against his margin loans, up from 181 million previously, representing a “near-term critical threat“ to unitholders.

“The deal Icahn is making to retail investors is, essentially, ‘buy ~$9 worth of value for ~$32 and I’ll give you back $2 of your own money per quarter, for free’,” it wrote, referring to the quarterly dividend payout. The price of Icahn Enterprises’ depositary units have since further declined, closing on Wednesday just below $24 each.

A week later, an analysis by the Financial Times showed Icahn’s investment portfolio had in fact lost money ever year since 2014. In the past six year alone, the newspaper found $6 billion in gains failed to offset $8.8 billion from losses on bearish bets. 

Speaking to the FT, Icahn acknowledged he had made mistakes and failed to heed his own advice and trading strategies that would have limited his losses. “I obviously believed the market was in for great trouble,” he explained, adding he was foiled by the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing that helped bolster equity pricesGot in some NVD calls. Going to go in with more calls/puts two weeks out from this week. Also, JP raised NVDA price from $250 to $500. Stonks only goes up!

The investors claimed that **Kraft Heinz and 3G Capital Partners made false and misleading statements about the sustainability of the company's margins and the success of cost-cutting strategies** after the merger. They alleged that the company's organic sales growth was declining and that Kraft Heinz was relying on acquisitions to maintain revenue growth. Furthermore, they claimed that the companies did not disclose the extent to which they were cutting back on marketing and research and development expenses to achieve their profit margins.

To settle claims and avoid further litigation **Kraft Heinz going to pay shareholders $450m in cash.**     
Any investor who has traded $KHC **(options included in the settlement as well)** could be eligible for part of that money. **You can calculate the payout and file for compensation** [**here**](https://11thestate.com/cases/kraft-heinz-settlement)**.** (also you can prepare the documents yourself and send them to the settlement administrator's address)Speaker just sent everyone home. Today is the 25th.

You need at least 4 days to get something through Congress. 1 day for everyone to return to Washington, 3 days for lawmakers to read whatever deal they come up with. Not to mention defections on either side.

Imagine they do come to a deal, say, tomorrow, they return to DC on Saturday, and they spend Sunday, Monday, Tuesday reading the bill. And on Wednesday, they vote. And it fails. What do you suppose will happen?

What if no deal emerges by today?

Do you expect Nvidia to save all you permabulls’ rears??

Not to mention the risk of a downgrade.

EDIT: Those who don’t think they’d read the bill, the rule was forced by Freedom Caucus as a condition of McCarthy’s speakership. Any less than that and they’d vacate the Speaker. And it seems so far that they’re serious about that requirement.Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.You have more money than you ever had before, (hell this might be your first time ever profiting from an options trade) now please subtract your new pot of money by at least 30% and that is how much you really have. The chances are strong you will go back to losing come tomorrow, as you go on a massive spending spree to maintain that brain high, but for the love of god do not spend the tax apportioned money you may owe come next year.


Though obviously your inevitable future losses will help offset some of that as well.**Come hang out with us on the NEW WallStreetBets[](https://twitter.com/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR) [Discord](https://discord.gg/wsbverse)!**

[Account #3. Maxed out my credit card, line of credit, and took some money from account #1 to put here.](https://preview.redd.it/at30q8147x1b1.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=968f768cc4f72f9aeb0f846592914e2445b5aed9)

Almost all of my losses came from being \~max margin short $NVDA during earnings (last earnings, not this one), and being \~max margin long during $ASTS earnings.

I've coped with these losses decently well I would like to think. I'm still up a ton from where I started (\~70k), but it kind of sucks not being a millionaire anymore. I used to pay the bill every time my friends and I would go out to eat, tip big, get haircuts often, eat out every single meal of the day (and be able to afford extra meat lol), etc. I don't feel secure doing that right now. It felt really good not having to worry about money.

The worst out of all this is that I promised my parents I would buy them a house, and I can no longer do that. Houses are 1.5m+ in my area, and at one point I could have literally bought it in cash. Instead, I gambled it all away. They were dejected but I can't go back to the past and change what happened. They'll have to live in a shitty apartment unfortunately until I can figure things out again.  

Let's look at the bright side (coping mechanism😔):

1. I made these mistakes at 22. I still have time to recover from losses (hopefully)
2. I already took out and spent \~150k buying my parent's cars, paying off their debts, and spending money on myself before I lost most the money
3. I haven't lost everything. Almost everything, but not everything.
4. I couldn't sleep at night with my extremely leveraged portfolio. I feel as if a weight has been taken off my back.
5. I am still alive, and healthy. We don't need much money nowadays to get our basic needs met. We don't need much money to be happy.

At the end of the day, I'm still thankful for everything I've been blessed with. I have clean water, food on the table, and a roof over my head. Sure, you need to strive and work towards greater heights, but you still need to appreciate what you have.

Lessons/Mistakes:

1. We underestimate tail risks (even if you know that you underestimate tail risks), and we underestimate how losses (and wins) can trigger a feedback loop of possibly portfolio-ending decisions (I literally wrote this on my last post before I lost my money, but I ended up losing it anyways😓)
2. The market is not rational. It doesn't care about your squiggly (or straight) lines or your discounted cash flow analysis (at least right away). Position yourself accordingly.
3. Have other things to do other than watching the market. I was researching/watching the market 10 hours+ a day some days. I stopped going to the gym. I stopped going to my classes. Etc. Just to watch the market and find some sort of alpha online. Being too active made me consistently switch my positions up, and made me unable to sit on my hands.
4. Position sizing. I would go all in on a single stock a lot of the time. Using margin as well.
5. Using margin. I was using maximum margin ever since I started investing/trading. I'm surprised I didn't get wiped a whole lot earlier. When you use max margin, you are forced to sell at the worst prices, and volatility drag occurs.
6. Shorting on max margin. This was pretty fking regarded, but it's what made me most of my money. When you short, you can only make a maximum of 100% but your risks are unlimited. Not an asymmetrical bet you'd want to take often imo.
7. Next time around, if I do "short", I would need to either do it using puts or be short stock with calls as hedges.
8. All or nothing mentality. Even when I already made it. This was pretty regarded as well. I could have gone all in on dividend stocks and never had to work a day in my life. But I didn't do that.
9. Probs a million other things

Don't really have much more to say, but take care of yourselves bros. Start hitting the gym. Talk to that girl (even if she makes you nervous). Make more money. Fix/strengthen your relationship with your friends and family. Find God. Find yourself a waifu (not Mikasa because she's taken). You get the point. 

GL frens WGMI 😎last week after some vertical spreads went against me and after rewatching the big short over a healthy breakfast of crayons, I decided to let 90k combined of SNOW and ZS assign. Despite the fact that several highly regarded members of the community told me to “close at open” I dont know what that means nor could I find the button. After being down more than $4k Tuesday morning I realized my balls had swelled to the size of watermelons and become coated in some sort of quartz-like powder which my doctor identified as “a layer of crushed diamonds.” When I returned to WSB I found many comments saying “RIP OP” and “SNOW always beats earnings.” This confirmed for me that I was on the right track, especially since I knew that SNOW Beats earnings every quarter because they issue weak guidance to beat expectations. At some point the chickens have to come home to roost. Many lesser regarded new friends on here sent their support and encouragement and gave me the strength to hold and reap the reward of -10% after hours dump. I closed out 200 shares last night before screenshot and 33 after. holding the remaining 67 in case we default and everything goes to 0. And my ZS short position which I am still in the red on. 

Since everyone keeps asking the blacked out line is my XOM long position which I am self conscious of because it has been too good of an investment and I dont want people to think I dont belong here. 

TLDR: I shorted a bunch of SNOW and made a few grand. Probably wasn’t worth the stress. 

P.S. you guys are great, thanks for rooting for meSo nvidia is up only 24% and AMD is up half of that when it did nothing. I think this means more pump for NVDA tomorrow

We need all money to pile into NVDA. Daddy Jensen take me to the moon please.


This reminds me of Tesla back in 20/21. I haven’t had such euphoria since daddy Cohen and Daddy Elon. Shit giving me hard erection

Listen folks, there was not enough trade volume to trust the current price of NVDA. It looks like there were a bunch of people buying, and no one selling and that pumped the price due to artificial scarcity. When the profit taking begins, the share price will fall rapidly. It will probably hold on to most of its gains as there will also be more buyers and not just more sellers in a higher volume environment.

If you won your NVDA, it will be a max dash to take your profits tomorrow morning. I suggest liquidating during pre market.

All y’all with huge unrealized gains on your options, hopefully you’re still ITM after pre market price action. Expect huge slippage when you’re selling your calls if you’re not deep ITM when options trading resumes. 


What happens after the pre market and opening sell off? FOMO dip buyers, scalpers, and passive funds rebalancing will help stem the losses to a degree. Or, the market will see a falling knife and steer clear.

Positions: long NVDSSold after hours at half 116.20 and the other at 118.20. Still have some 6/16 calls.
Shares are so much easier to manage. The ability to sell after hours or pre-market is huge.This are the tweets from Jim Cramer regarding NVDA today:

https://preview.redd.it/2zlog65kqx1b1.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e9b97454e3b5082742a8991da7ab0a5157f81e5a

The first one was made before the earnings data (1:38 PM PDT (California time)). NVDA earnings release was at 2:00 PM

In theory is a bullish tweet if you assume that he loves his dog. But algos (AI) may have interpreted it like "NVDA is like a dog" so it will "underperform".

Maybe that sparked a signal on the algos and they started to bid NVDA shares helping to drive it to ATHs (I bet advanced algos support the inverseCramer signal)

Some hours later Cramer started tweeting clearly unambiguous bullish tweets about NVDA. The thing is that he tweeted those after trading was closed. After hours trading ends at 8:00 PM ET (which is 5:00 PM PDT) and he did that tweet at 5:13 PM PDT

Wow! Will the Algos reverse and sell tomorrow?

It will be interesting to see what happens***After reporting earnings today:***

Yes Nvidia beat on most metrics, but that's not the main reason the stock is flying.

***The main reason: AI***

AI is hot and Nvidia is at the center of it. Hot Sector + Good Earnings = ExplosionLast earnings Costco went haywire with more than 20% down. I lost more than 20K in a single night. This time I think it will shoot for the sky. What are your thoughts my fellow regards?

Do you think it will moon?
Or, you think it will nose-dive like last time? I can see people can argue this point as $BJ’s earning was not good. 

Disclaimer: This time I have not bought any puts or calls yet.took SPY and QQQ puts yesterday.Thought about closing but decided to hold. Ran my calculation AH and thought I was fucked.woke up this morning to a pleasant surprise and took gains of \~$3k.

Thinking Nvidia earning already happened yesterday AH or pre market today,I took 6/30 Nvidia puts for $4k based on my own thoughts. didn't check wsb all day.Markets close, then NVDA earnings, I'm fooked big time.

I guess my wife is staying with her boyfriend after allHey,

Does anyone here have experience with the shareholder foundation for significant loss on stock? 

I’ve contacted them and they said they will work with a legal team and get back to me.

Was curious if anyone knew about this process or how to get funds back. 

ThanksEasy play.. Nvidia has the monopoly on general purpose AI which chatgpt is used. Other companies are way behind.  Inversed cnbc, Cramer, and wallstreetbets. 

This is crazy ride. Gonna be 100‰ IVGambling in all forms - day trading, crypto, sports betting (in the name of fantasy sports), has become pervasive. It's everywhere and in your face. And the target are the most vulnerable who can least afford to lose money on it.

Try to clearly define what is gambling and what isn't so people can reliably avoid gambling. You won't be able to do it because the financialized economy is a big unavoidable casino. You can define extreme cases of clear gambling like slot machines, but the opposite isn't true. There are no extreme "definitely 100% not gambling" examples. At best you can identify things that are relatively less gambling like.

Even things that were considered canonical not gambling examples have become more like gambling. Ex: Buying a house. When people used to put 20% down, carefully shop for months, and live in a house their whole lives that's not gambling.

But now? People buy houses at 10-20x leverage, waive inspection, and go from tour to offer in 2 days. Job loss for either spouse could mean foreclosure. If the market doesn't appreciate quickly enough they will be underwater. Everything is a casino.Bought this morning, sold shortly after FOMC figuring my whole trade idea was fucked. Now this. On pic 3 you can see limit price of .08. The 500 was supposed to be a limit stop order. I fat fingered it while at work. This trade would have almost cleared my sins. Pltr to the 🌚&#x200B;

Wonder what the stock price will be @ open..?Well going into today I actually found myself to be fairly bullish and I truly expected a bounce and for us to close much higher than we closed yesterday. However, that clearly did not happen and clearly was wrong to be a bull up here. 

Looking at SPY and QQQ daily here it would appear that I was a day early… With SPY and QQQ closing out there abandoned baby daily bullish reversal candles honestly the temptation to swing calls is insanely high… However, I actually back tested my swing trades dating back to early 2022 and I actually am net negative on swings alone… so as much as they are enticing… not worth it to me. 

Now for those of you that don’t know what the abandoned baby pattern is… it’s a rarity and doesn’t always play out but when it does it usually results in a pretty massive move up… May 4th is the best example of that daily pattern.

There is literally nothing else that I can describe this market right now then “WOW.” I Just can not imagine the fact that a company with a PE near 200 can rally almost 27% on earnings and be near the ATHs… that truly is mindboggling. 

This market reminds me a lot of the spring of 2021… 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmxx7f3j1v1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d3d5cef6baa1526e4ff58e48976169e2ee9afe3

Now from a supply and demand stand point we didn’t do anything different today. The most intriguing thing is the fact that we actually gapped under the 413.05 supply. So generally speaking to have a previous supply taken out you must close a new supply over it and then you must touch that level with price action… a gap down completely changes that metric. So for now that 413.05 level remains on the books. 

We did come down and test 410.2 demand (Support) and hold that nicely today. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema for the first time since May 4th. 

Honestly, I can no help but notice the similarities of todays candle to May 4ths daily candle. If that is the case we likely could see a green open tomorrow and green day tomorrow. This would give us an opportunity to turn 411.16 into a new higher demand. 

However, IF bears can continue this momentum lower then more likely than not our target is daily demand (support) at 404.32/ 405.12. The daily DMI has officially reset to over sold but has not started its wave up. So we are in the early stages of finding the next bottom…. However, keep in mind that the DMI can remain oversold for a period of time before it retraces.

On the Daily we clearly broke through support of the red and black rising wedge. We also closed a full candle below the daily 20ema. However, we once again are finding support at the daily 50ema. 

We will keep an eye on this blue bear channel with resistance at 415.2 for tomorrow. In all honestly it appears that I was just one day too early on the bull rally… with NVDA this very well is the dip buy opportunity before we push hard to the 420-430 area again. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 413 -> 418.8  
 Demand- 410.2 -> 405.1  
 Support- 411.1 -> 410.2 -> 408.9  
 Resistance- 412.5 -> 414.1 -> 417.1

Futures came down and took out that 4149 supply that they had fell just short of yesterday. With this log wicked doji I do expect some upside tomorrow. However, the one interesting thing here is that right now this new daily candle has still not tried to put a new demand (support) in… DMI remainds oversold though so favor would be a short term bounce coming soon. 

If we get a green day and green bounce on futures tomorrow with a closure over 4165 then we should try to turn 4145 into a new demand (Support). 

However, if we fall through 4127 demand tomorrow then our target would be 4075 demand.

Same story here on futes is that we did push a daily candle through the red and black daily rising wedge and now we find ourselves looking at this blue resistance line and that 4159 will be a major resistance to watch that futures actually is hard rejecting after hours here. 

If this is a back test and rejection of the daily 8ema on futures this could be a very bearish movement with the ultimate target being 4095 support. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4055 -> 4208  
 Demand- 4128 -> 4075  
 Support- 4125 -> 4110 -> 4095   
 Resistance- 4159 -> 4171 -> 4190 -> 4208

QQQ did close the same bullish abandoned baby pattern here as SPY… QQQ missed its intraday gap fill by about 9 cents. 

The daily 20ema will sit just over that 326.82 supply tomorrow and if the bears can continue to sell the markets off (which will be very hard to see QQQ drop with NVDA up 28%) then we should target that 326.82 supply. Looking here you can see we have a major demand (support) are at 325/326 and that should be a big area where we could bounce If we do see a continuation sell off. 

However, if we get a green day tomorrow we likely will see the DMI wave back up with a new demand being established at 331.32. This would lead QQQ to target 336.37 demand. I actually will look to take some longer 14-30dte calls on QQQ if we do see that play out tomorrow. 

QQQ Daily Levels  
 Supply- 337.6 -> 326.82 -> 322.31  
 Demand- 336.37 -> 325.99 -> 34.99

**VIX**

One reason I am also particularly bullish is the fact that the VIX attempted to break out over that critical 20.08 level and rejected. This rejection is a near perfect double top off the May 4th VIX candle which is when SPY put its bottom in… 

If the VIX retraces tomorrow and closes under 20.08 again then I would feel far more confident that we are going to see a bigger upside move on SPY…

The next major upside level for the VIX is 21.36 and downside level is 18.86.

Honestly this was a terrible trading day just from a day trading stand point… 0dte premiums were so juiced because of Yellen and FOMC minutes and we had really such little overall movement that plays just weren’t paying out very well… I really did okay trading intraday and my day trades were green by my swing calls were obviously red and that gave me a good sized hole.

Seems like all the bears have been getting squeezed to absolute nothingness. After seeing it rally another 20% after earnings today one has to ask themselves, is it time to short the chip manufacturing giant NVDA. With a whopping 750B Market cap is it really worth the price we see on our brokerages. 
If you ask me I’d say maybe it’s time to take some profits and flip a little bit bearish but who am I?I was thinking skipping the recap today as there is no Fed or economic updates. But then NVDA earnings call... And just like that, nothing else matters... Congrats to the NVDA bulls and RIP to the bears. 

https://reddit.com/link/13qxdqe/video/p5s0szy5eu1b1/playerWas heavily wrong with yesterdays gamble. Don’t care doubled down mid day. Down on the day ~7k. Think we still will be above 418 by Friday of this week. 

I don’t pay attention to after hours/pre market much as most of the time it’s BS so don’t fully trust the pump that NVDA has as of 4:45pm EST but we will see.

The reason I am currently playing like this is because I am currently up 28k on the month of may. These bets aren’t going to make or break my life. I do not recommend anyone follow my plays as I have been wrong countless times. Just my gut feeling with these plays. Start of each month play tighter and if up by the end go for the yolos.

Most interesting numbers are the cost of production (\~1600 USD), projected cost (other sources are saying \~3000 USD), capacity (\~70k monthly), and quantity (half a mil by second quarter). For reference  i think the oculus is priced from around 400-1000 depending on spec, with similar profit margins.

Not saying to load up on calls (especially since the announcement is still just rumored), but AAPL has been trading down recently due to declining iPhone sales and a rating downgrade. But if Tim Cook channels his inner Steve Jobs and kills the demo, the long term revenue stream might be quite good as developers flock in.NVDA may hold promise for the future, but its current Price to Earnings (PE) and Price to Sales (PS) ratios are less than impressive. Earnings appear stagnant, with PC gaming in decline. The majority of their profit is derived from data services, rather than Al.

Moreover, we're grappling with the debt ceiling limit. When analyzing patterns from past 'blood weeks', history shows NVDA experienced a 30% drop during such events. The economic outlook is not favorable and there's a downward trend, as evidenced by the overvaluation of PPD. Despite being hyped and exceeding $100 due to strong buying pressure for a significant period, it now faces a 40% reduction.

Add to that the ongoing uncertainty around the China trade war, and you have a multitude of reasons contributing to a potential decrease in the stock's value.

Disclosure: I hold over 17k short positions in NVDA. My investment track record is far from flawless - I lost approximately 80k last March and, to date, Fidelity has yet to retrieve my funds. So, my struggles in the market are evident. Let's proceed.Why did selling their real estate portfolio entice investors to buy their shares? The only possible positive I can glean from this scenario is that some of the loans in that portfolio were suffering high unrealized losses from interest rate hikes, but that doesn't seem like the case. One argument I keep seeing for the positive is that "this helps keep them afloat longer", but I find that not compelling at all to buy their shares. Now, they were said to have had 15 billion in liquidity (if I am remembering correctly) after the announcement of the \~10% deposit loss in the first quarter which far exceeded the uninsured deposits. So the rush to sell of assets like this only points to further deposit flight in my opinion. The other scenario is that the 11 bil in short term borrowings has an unsustainable interest cost. A combination of these two problems is probably the most likely. Even if they put all of the proceeds from the sale of the real estate portfolio to their short term obligations, it still leaves a huge chunk of high-rate short term debt that seems untenable given the state of their deposits. So why did the market view this as a good sign? Were they just realizing they have a little more time to squeeze some more money out of the business or has PacWest's position fundamentally changed for the better?today Fed meeting minutes show Federal Reserve officials at their May meeting were divided over whether further interest-rate increases would be necessary to lower inflation

Client-flow data from Bank of America’s equities trading desk underscore the outsize demand from companies compared with other investors this year. Although the bank’s clients have purchased a net $8.5 billion of equities this year in aggregate through mid-May, they actually sold $25.3 billion excluding their buyback activity.

Now, I’m my defense lol there are parts that were omitted in which I say “this is bottom for banks” on May 4th and I sold tons of puts on PACW. But hey, this is WSJ after all lololololI’m so sick of seeing the loss porn here and the literal lives financially ruined from gambling. So I will share my story in the facts that it helps. Started investing 18 months ago with 20k, bought in high lost down to 12k. Started playing options down to 8.5k perfected my strategy now 8k to 40k in 6 weeks. And if I actually followed my own damn advice and stuck to just my strategy I would be at 160k.  You have to be patient. Find what works and stick to it and don’t chase action that doesn’t fit your proven strategy. Mine is simple, doesn’t even involve reading graphs, it hedges risk, and maximizes reward. Don’t pay 2k to some ahole saying he will show you his strategy, if it truly worked they would have money to where your 2k didn’t mean shit. It’s very hard to beat the computers but there is a way. Without going into too much detail my strategy focuses on specific stock price points, terms, and volatility, earnings,that’s it (but it is so specific only one or two positions each week line up). So when the chance lines up I take it. sometimes no trades for a week, maybe 3 trades on a great week. But the key is not to get on a high when one hits and go chasing, like I said if I didn’t do that I would have 4x what I have now. But the key is to find what works, stick to it no matter what, have your stop losses in place (35 percent works for me, less and I miss opportunity, and hedging usually makes that 35 percent up and some). Just don’t gamble, you will lose. But if you ever see me trying to sell you my formula run, if everyone adopted it the market would adjust, I don’t expect it to last forever but hopefully I can adopt with it.  Now stay tuned for my master class for only $9,999!!!So colour me a conspiracy theorist, but I had a thought the other day reading about the US debt ceiling. I read an article that said if the US reaches its debt ceiling without agreement to increase it, the US could default and there could be a knock on effect of a recession.

&#x200B;

Now our friend J-Pow has been hiking interest rates like crazy lately trying to bring down inflation. Hes hoping to reduce demand by increasing interest rates....maybe even causing a recession/depression as a result to get the inflation levels down. Except its not really happening for him. Its blowing up banks and scaring rich folk instead. 

&#x200B;

So a part of me thinks that the debt ceiling will be hit and a small default allowed happen. Enough to cause a recession, but not enough to cause irreparable reputational damage to the US. 

&#x200B;

Maybe I shouldn't have eaten the purple crayon for lunch....but it smelt so gooooodThe claim the US has never defaulted is BS.

https://preview.redd.it/04vuk6x20t1b1.jpg?width=301&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a5ed330a3cd0284308c85f435c07bc8aba4d7fef

Whenever I hear someone say the US just cant default, it has never defaulted, it would be a complete Armageddon, it makes me laugh. Being a student of history, or at least the history I am aware of, I can point to 4 times the US has defaulted.

Now, before you get your underwear in a bundle, a default is when the issuer doesn't pay the debt/bond holder. I know people like to play fun with words but that's what it is, period.

Here are the Greatest hits of the United States Default tour of 1862 to ????.

&#x200B;

1. 1862 - US sold Demand Notes to fund the Civil War. Government printed paper money ie "Greenbacks." and they devalued vs gold. Default #1.
2. 1933 - US issued Gold Bonds which could be redeemed for gold coin. Until the Govt decided instead to "pay back" the gold bonds in paper currency. Default #2
3. 1968 - US refused to honor the terms of Silver Certificate Paper dollars which stated that they could be redeemed for actual silver dollars. Adding insult to injury, the Govt voted in 1965 that Silver Dollars no longer had to be Silver. Default #3 and Screwjob #2034
4. 1971 - Dollars held by foreign governments were supposed to be able to be redeemed for gold, under the Bretton Woods agreement, the agreement that forced the world onto the dollar. Govt said nope, and the world has never been the same. Btw, the dollars for gold was the FOUNDATION of the Bretton Woods agreement.

So, the US government has defaulted FOUR times.

Interestingly, #2 went to the Supreme Court where the power of the US Government to default was upheld.

\#4 great quote: Then Treasurt Secty said in response: "The dollar is our currency but its your (foreign nations) problem."

And the trend of the US saying F U to other nations, began. Freaking Nixon.

Look, the world and US citizens have already experienced the US govmt sayin nah, we ain't paying. And yet, the US marches on.

Again, to me one of the greatest risks for the country financially and geopolitically is the overt move by nations to move OFF the dollar. If I was them, I would want to do the same thing. The dollar is the single greatest weapon that the US has.

Finally, I reiterate that all of this drama is BS. Seriously, This would not be the first time the US defaulted. Nor the first time the US was downgraded.

I like my SPY calls, my QQQ calls, and my VIX calls.- buy a Singapore condo right now. 

- US citizens like us pay 0% stamp duty tax where ass other country people’s pay 60%. So $1M condo for them is $1.6M. 

- and the government there will lower it later in a couple years

- $555K USD gets you a 1 bedroom in marine parade which is like the beach area. 

- or if your a super cheap ass you can buy leasehold or the red light district (which I heard is lit)

- you can rent them units for $2700-$3000 USD a month

- but the true value is location

- Singapore the Swiss of the East. With both Chinese and westerners wanting a safe place to place cash

- fat pharma, biotech, chips, finance 

- in Hong Kong a 400 sqft 1 bed is like $1M USD

- so if ur bitch ass not buying in Singapore idk what to say

- if you don’t have $500K sucks for you

- I heard from vice there’s 10,000+ escorts there

- bad bitches, good jobs, hot ass weather

- f1, sail GP

- bad bitches and palm treesThey are going to report crappy earnings, maybe they can sell their future with AI well enough to go up 2%-3% tomorrow, but there is a solid chance with the market sentiment right now that this stocks goes down 20%+ tomorrow.

We've got a burning question about the unthinkable scenario of a US debt default and its potential impact on our dream of owning a HOUSE 🏡🚀. Strap in and get ready for some wild speculation, Wall Street style!

Picture this: if the US were to default on its debt, we're talking about a financial doomsday 💣📉. The repercussions would be catastrophic, with interest rates soaring, markets crashing, and chaos reigning supreme! 🌍📉

But here's where it gets interesting, my fellow degenerates. In times of financial turmoil, opportunities can emerge amidst the chaos. If the housing market takes a massive hit, it's not inconceivable to imagine a mad rush of deals and distressed sellers flooding the scene! 📉💼💰

So, the burning question is this: Could a US debt default potentially open up a golden opportunity for us to score a sweet deal on a house? 🏠💸 Imagine the possibility of insane price drops, desperate sellers, and banks itching to unload properties left and right! It's a potential goldmine for those brave enough to take the plunge 📉💎🚀.Just placed a huge (for me) bet on SPCE stock. They have flights starting tomorrow taking humans to sub orbit. One of a kind company. IMO this is the next Tesla.Life insurance is a crazy weird investment. Your essentially betting your gonna roll bad on your saving throws to beat the odds and get a crazy annualized ROI. 

Say I got term life insurance for myself $300k for $500 a year. If I croak before the first year is over that’s a $500 investment for a $300,000 return. That’s  a 60,000% annual ROI. If I croak in the last year of the policy that’s w $15,000 investment for $300,000 over 30 years. Still a respectable 67.7% annual ROI. 

The issue is if you don’t die in 30 years, then your investment is gone. Shits a yolo investment. Insurance companies are betting on you canceling the policy well before you get your payout as well so the best strategy is to hold up till the very end.GM,

# Transaction Selection

1. All Open Market Transactions from May 15th - May 19th. These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. Both indirect and direct transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from May 8th - May 12th.
4. No companies without a ticker
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as backfill which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is \*roughly\* 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings. That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included \*if\* the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data was pulled by the algorithms behind Form Fore

Look back at previous times when the Govmt was playing around about a headline fiscal policy. For "some reason" it took market weakness for the them to act.

This market weakness, may not be manufactured but it certainly is intended to put pressure on Washington to stop f'ing around. What will be perfect is if it continues through this Friday so the "news" can chirp about the end of the world the entire holiday weekend. Watch how fast those idiots in Wash get it done next week.

Its so transparent. And Bc of that, I am looking to close my shorter dated VIX calls next week. I was commenting to one of members that the fact that my longer dated VIX calls are moving more tells me what the market expects past the inevitable debt ceiling deal - more Vol.

In the meantime, I am happy to do my job for the Bears and buy my SPY and QQQ calls at the high. will be adding more to those Friday also.

There will be a rally, temporary of course, when the debt deal gets done.

If you own short duration VIX calls, and you know who you are, I would be closing some of them over the next couple of days. Profit is profit. These arent going to the moon. Yet.I am 500 shares short @ 199.55  
I also have 10 naked call contracts and some covered puts (which will be my bubble gum money).

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-26.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean "cheaper." High numbers mean "expensive." A 1 means "fairly" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have "weeklies", the underlying is "too cheap", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.
* **How should this be improved?** Do you have any suggestions or notice any bugs with this report?A week before the OPEC+ ministers' meeting, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman is again threatening to cut production.

The prince is known for speaking his mind. He has previously sent short-sellers the message that they would be ["hurting,"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/saudi-arabia-says-opec-will-deal-with-oil-speculators?leadSource=uverify%20wall) complained about [underinvestment in the oil industry](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-energy-minister-says-focusing-only-renewables-mistake-2022-02-20/), and denied rumors about [increasing production](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2203656/business-economy).

Sometimes, he unexpectedly cuts production, as he did in early April, on a Sunday no less. In short, he's not a fan of low prices.

However, it's important to remember that the more he cuts production, the less enthusiastic his OPEC colleagues become, which in turn increases the likelihood that they will ramp up production, thus putting downward pressure on prices.

Nonetheless, his speeches do have a short-term effect - **prices are rising today**.

Still, I wouldn't rule out a reduction in production following the OPEC+ meeting. This could be a group decision, or it could be a unilateral Saudi initiative.

However, the impact **won't be as dramatic as it was in April**, and it **will also fade without demand** support.Is it “too much cash on sidelines” vs “fed will suck out all liquidity” as in after debt ceiling thing is resolved fed is going to completely destroy liquidity?https://www.foxnews.com/media/target-customers-shocked-company-features-gay-pride-items-satanist-partner-devil-hope-love

Looks like the right is now calling for a boycott of Target and it looks like they are more pissed then they were over the Budlight debacle.  Could be a good short or put play for next ER.  What do you all think?Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.**Come hang out with us on the NEW WallStreetBets[](https://twitter.com/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR) [Discord](https://discord.gg/wsbverse)!**

Everyone knows that there will be a compromise and everything will go smoothly back to normal. But what I can't shake is knowing that every one of these politicians and their friends are putting in puts and calls and setting themselves up to make millions every time this thing yo-yos. And when they finally do "compromise" they will be in the perfect situation to financially benefit. And they will only "compromise" so that we can repeat this cycle again and again every couple of years.

US stock markets experienced a dip, and short-term Treasury bills extended their losses as the negotiation process to increase the US debt ceiling hit a wall.

Negotiations resumed on Tuesday, but the pace of progress was sluggish. The urgency asserted by Treasury Secretary Yellen's deadline for looming debt payments was challenged by several House Republicans.

As the window of opportunity for a political resolution narrows, investors are seeking higher premiums for holding US debt, particularly those securities at the highest risk of default. For instance, the securities yields due to maturity on June 8 exceed 5.7%, while those maturing on May 30 hover around 2%.

Following their meeting on Monday, President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy characterized the discussions as fruitful. Nonetheless, consensus on the debt ceiling remains out of reach. McCarthy has urged Republicans to stay unified in their demands to forestall a potential US default.

# Unraveling the FOMC Minutes: What to Expect from Tomorrow's Release

Tomorrow, May 24th, we will witness important economic events that could influence the financial markets.

Firstly, at 12:40 pm ET, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller is scheduled to deliver a speech. Market participants closely watch Governor Waller's words as they often provide insights into the Federal Reserve's thinking on monetary policy and the health of the economy.

Following this, at 2:00 pm ET, we'll have the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held in May. The minutes are a detailed record of the committee's policy-setting meeting, and they provide an in-depth description of the economic and financial conditions that influenced their vote on where to set interest rates. The FOMC minutes also offer insights into the Fed's view on economic growth, inflation, and other factors affecting the U.S. economy.

# FOMC Minutes – What to Expect

The Federal Reserve will release the minutes from the May FOMC meeting tomorrow. During the meeting, policymakers raised the policy rate by 25 basis points to 5-5.25%, a unanimously approved move took the Fed funds rate to a level not seen since August 2007​[**1**](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/03/fed-rate-decision-may-2023-.html)​​[**2**](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/03/fed-rate-decision-may-2023-.html)​​[**3**](https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/23/05/32534993/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expect)​​[**4**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expectations-diverge-with-fed-reality-1032346237). In addition, the Fed signaled that it is shifting to a data-dependent approach​[**5**](https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/23/05/32534993/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expect)​​[**6**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expectations-diverge-with-fed-reality-1032346237).

Many on Wall Street believe the May rate hike might have been the last in this cycle; a sentiment also echoed by market participants. Consequently, bets on several interest rate cuts starting from the third quarter of this year have increased​[**7**](https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/23/05/32534993/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expect)​​[**8**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expectations-diverge-with-fed-reality-1032346237).

Investors will be keen to scrutinize the minutes to see if the FOMC participants are satisfied with the current interest rates and whether circumstances warrant further tightening​[**9**](https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/23/05/32534993/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expect)​​[**10**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expectations-diverge-with-fed-reality-1032346237). Chairman Jerome Powell had previously hinted that the path ahead was less clear for interest rate hikes as policymakers assess incoming data and financial conditions​[**11**](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/03/fed-rate-decision-may-2023-.html).

The minutes could also shed light on various other concerns, including the danger posed by regional banks, credit tightening, policymakers' perspectives on the debt limit crisis, and the economic outlook​[**12**](https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/23/05/32534993/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expect)​​[**13**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expectations-diverge-with-fed-reality-1032346237). Markets now assign a 75% probability of the Fed keeping rates unchanged in June and factor in about 160 basis points of interest rate cuts until November 2024​[**14**](https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/23/05/32534993/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expect)​​[**15**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expectations-diverge-with-fed-reality-1032346237).

Interestingly, some Fed speakers have lately sounded slightly more hawkish than anticipated. For instance, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard recently backed two more hikes in 2023, and the New York Fed's John Williams suggested that the natural level of interest rates could be higher than before the pandemic. In contrast, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari appeared more dovish, indicating openness to a rate pause on June​[**16**](https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/23/05/32534993/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expect)**,**​​[**17**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expectations-diverge-with-fed-reality-1032346237).

Finally, some assets exposed to rate expectations and growth outlook will likely experience volatility due to the FOMC minutes. The Ishares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF (NYSE: SHY) and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: TLT) are particularly sensitive. The stock market, including the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) and the QQQ Invesco Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), will also be closely watching for potential realignment of rate cut expectations​[**18**](https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/23/05/32534993/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expect)​​[**19**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expectations-diverge-with-fed-reality-1032346237).

Stay tuned for the release of the FOMC minutes, which are anticipated to provide an important reality check for market interest rate expectations​[**20**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/what-to-watch-when-fomc-minutes-drop-pain-for-stocks-bonds-looms-if-market-expectations-diverge-with-fed-reality-1032346237)

# Dividing Lines: The Hunt for a Bipartisan Solution to the Looming Debt Crisis​

Today, on May 23, 2023, President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy held discussions on the debt ceiling at the White House. The meeting was characterized as "productive" and "professional" by McCarthy, but no deal was reached by the end of the day. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has reaffirmed the June 1 date as the earliest the U.S. could be at serious risk of debt default. This issue was one of the key topics during Biden and McCarthy's meeting.

A main sticking point in the talks remains the mandatory spending caps. McCarthy said he and his team would "come back together and work through the night" on a compromise deal. He and Biden know the impending deadline and intend to communicate daily until a resolution is found.

Biden emphasized the need for a deal that can be "sold to both sides" of a closely divided Congress. McCarthy shared this sentiment, expressing cautious optimism that they can find common ground to strengthen the economy, address the debt, and get the government moving again to curb inflation and reduce dependency on China.

McCarthy also noted that the reality of the legislative process was starting to impact his decision-making. He stressed the importance of finalizing a deal this week to allow it to pass in the House and then move to the Senate to meet the June 1 deadline. He also stated his willingness to keep the House in session as long as necessary to pass a bill.

There seems to be a sense of urgency and concern among the negotiators. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had characterized a potential debt default in early June as "highly likely," a shift from the previous week when it was described as merely "likely." McCarthy has also expressed a belief that June 1 is a firm deadline.

Meanwhile, GOP Representative Tom Graves of Georgia, who has been serving as a Republican point man on the ongoing negotiations, indicated that both sides are inching closer toward a consensus. Graves noted some areas where they are "very close" to the agreement, though he was reluctant to elaborate on specifics.

Graves said, "There's more that unites us than divides us," which offers hope for a bipartisan agreement. A glimmer of this hope could also be seen in the White House's statement asserting their belief in the existence of space for a bipartisan agreement.

Most of the bipartisan talks have been dedicated to preserving the vaccine program. As The New York Times reported, officials from both sides are making efforts to ensure that the program continues receiving funding amidst the debt talks. The importance of this measure cannot be understated, especially considering the global implications of a potential disruption in the American vaccine program.

On the other hand, US GOP Representative Patrick McHenry has pointed out that the "top line disagreement" is still on spending—the spending caps - whether mandatory or discretionary - remain contentious between the two parties.

While some might view the discussions as a deadlock, others see it as a significant part of reaching a mutually agreeable solution. The American public and the world are closely watching as this political drama unfolds. Despite the complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved, many remain hopeful that a consensus will be reached soon, averting a potential debt default.

The gravity of the situation is apparent. If a resolution isn't reached, the ripple effect of the United States defaulting on its debt could have far-reaching implications not just for the U.S. but for the global economy. It is hoped that the spirit of bipartisan cooperation will shine through these discussions and lead to a resolution to sustain the country's economic stability and continue supporting crucial programs like the vaccine initiative.

The clock is ticking, and the pressure is mounting.

# SPY Technical Outlook

https://preview.redd.it/gl817i4mao1b1.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c9d42f233fbbbd90d4b9d5efd0c26115c3da18a8

Tomorrow's SPY analysis shows mixed sentiments. The daily chart looks bullish, and we're eyeing buying opportunities around 411.93-410.65. On the 1-hour chart, we're neutral to bearish but watchful for a bounce around the same block. The 15-minute chart remains bearish unless we see a structure change at 415.07 or bounce off the 411.93-410.65 order block. Stay vigilant on the market's response to the debt ceiling talks, as they could affect the current dynamics.

**Daily Chart**

Examining the daily chart, the expected dip observed today draws my focus toward potential buying opportunities on the buy side. Simultaneously, I will closely watch the ongoing debt ceiling talks and their influence on market dynamics. As we approach the bullish order block, there is an optimistic outlook for favorable prospects in the market. This sentiment is further reinforced if positive news emerges from the talks.

Regarding the Daily Chart, I'm not interested in considering puts at the current level unless we drop below 408.

We're currently searching for support within the 412.83 - 414.43 FVG or the 411.93 410.65 bullish order block in the buy-side markdowns, so familiarize yourself with your reversal patterns and seek them on the smaller timeframes. I'm watching for a touch of the 411.93 - 410.65 bullish order block myself.

Bias: Neutral - Bearish (*oversold on the RSI)(no support has been established yet on the 1 Hour timeframe)*

Bullish Break of Structure *(uptrend continues)*: 420.40 *(Breach this level, and we should look for a new high.)*

Bearish Break of Structure: 413.68 (*Breach this level, and we should look to the Bullish Order Block and lower end of buys side-discounts)*

Bullish Order Block: 411.93 - 410.65 *(Lose this block, and we will need to reassess)*

Major Change of Structure: 418.00 *(A candle close above this level, and we should look to test 420)*

Minor Change of Structure: 415.07 *(A handle close above, and we should look to fill the bearish FVG at 417.32 - 416.93)*

**15 Minute Chart**

The 15-minute graph remains bearish. If a structural shift at 415.07 happens before reaching the bullish order block at 411.93 - 410.65, I'd be at ease scalping calls to the 416.55 - 417.15 bearish FVG. If we disrupt the structure at 413.68, I'll monitor the bullish order block for a possible rebound. Keep in mind, nothing on the 15-minute chart suggests we've hit bottom.

Bias: Bearish

Should we fracture the character shift at 415.07, and if the 416.55 - 417.15 FVG persists as resistance, here's the bearish viewpoint.

Catch y’all on the flip side 🚀 🚀During the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, the Russell 2000 fell 24% in a week, while the S&P 500 fell 17%.

One way to play this is to buy puts on the Russell 2000. You can buy 1-month 95% puts on the Russell 2000 for 0.85% of the notional value. This is a bet that the Russell 2000 will decline by at least 5% within a month.

The Russell 2000 could underperform in a future debt ceiling crisis. The Russell 2000 is more heavily weighted toward small-cap stocks. Small-cap stocks are typically more volatile than large-cap stocks. The Russell 2000 also has a higher allocation to cyclical stocks. Cyclical stocks are more sensitive to economic conditions and can be more volatile in times of economic turmoil.

If the US were to default on its debt, it could lead to a debt ceiling crisis. A debt ceiling crisis would likely cause a sell-off in stocks, and it could also lead to a rise in interest rates. This would be harmful to small-cap stocks and cyclical stocks, which are already more volatile than large-cap stocks.The VIX spiked to a peak of 48 during the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, from around 20.

You can play this by buying $25-$35 June exp call spreads on the VIX for $0.68, by buying one $25 VIX call June exp and selling one $35 VIX call June exp

A calamity with the debt ceiling could cause the VIX to surge massively. This is because a default would be a major event that would have a significant impact on the market. A default would likely lead to a sell-off in stocks and bonds, and it could also lead to a rise in interest rates.I'm relatively new here (1 yr), and haven't actually made any money off the "Non-Financial Advice" that's found here.  but i do like to know the history of things I'm interested in, like WSB.  As i understand it, [u/ItalianVillageVinnie](https://www.reddit.com/user/ItalianVillageVinnie/) drew the original baby.  but in the comments from 3 years ago, they had already changed the logo? then theres reference to a baby Bezos logo? so was this the original logo?

**The Economy**

US S&P Global Manufacturing PMI May P: 48.5 (est 50.0; prev 50.2) - Services PMI: 55.1 (est 52.5; prev 53.6) - Composite PMI: 54.5 (est 53.0; prev 53.4). Manufacturing is experiencing the impact of soft demand and a relatively high level of inventory at retailers, while the service sector is benefiting from increased demand in travel and leisure. This situation is likely to benefit headline Consumer Price Index (CPI), but core CPI, particularly super core CPI, may face upward pressure.

**The Business**

Today, several consumer companies reported sales misses. LOW, AZO, BJ's, and DKS all fell short on sales. This was expected for LOW but surprising for AZO, considering the rising average age of used cars in the US. When looking at these earnings results as well as those of HD, TGT, WMT, and FL, it becomes apparent that consumer spending is softening. Consumers are reducing discretionary spending and opting for lower-priced alternatives. Currently, corporate margins remain intact or are even expanding, but this trend may change if demand continues to decline.

JPM: "Profit margins currently stand at 11.8%, a level of profitability that had only been eclipsed once in the pre-pandemic period."

This chart very directly showed how Fed saved the regional and small banks. The good news is that small banks can replenish their deposit loss with the help of funds from the Fed. However, the downside is that they have to pay a significant price for those funds. Considering that the yield curve is still highly inverted, it is challenging to make a bullish case for banks.

The mega caps are priced for a booming economy whereas small caps are priced for a recession. This gap needs to be closed, one way or the other.

Added some QQQ puts today. Let's see if this is the leg.I was the one who called 4200 by Friday on Tuesday of last week (made 10k that day). Then called for a 1-1.5% drop within the week yesterday with my 15k put play (only made 4k off that since I weak handed it). Check post history and comments within the posts for proof.

Now twitter/y’all went extreme bearish instantly again so back with calls for a break above 4200 by this Friday.

Before the bears absolutely took the bulls by the horn middle of day and plunged them off the cliff… I was targeting two major support areas on SPY and QQQ for tomorrow… while anyone who follows me know on a daily time frame my timing may not always be perfect (as I expected tomorrow) my levels almost always play out… Being that these levels played out a day early for me… I actually am expecting a bounce tomorrow… or by EOW minimally. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hxa53g2y7n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6d9edd08661ed0bfc105f93d96e8f07a70d2aec7

From a supply and demand standpoint we had a huge day… so we put in a new supply (resistance) at 418.78. This now makes this 418.78 to 419.5 a major supply and resistance area. In doing this we have no retraced all the way back down to take out 416.75, 415.58 and 413.91… we did fall just shy of touching 413.05 supply just under the daily 20ema though. 

Taking out the daily 8ema is a bearish omen for the markets, however, bouncing off the 20ema like we did today is bullish in nature. This should be seen as a support bounce rather than a bigger sell off for now. 

However, IF we continue to leg down tomorrow and close a candle under 413.05 supply which is the daily 20ema then I actually might be more apt for a that we see a retrace back to 410.2 demand (Support) before we bounce. This might be an example of being a day early for the bounce. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4anbi8ly7n1b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f3c4ca0c83f33def5b21cab77bf7dc98aecc1d49

Bears took us all the way down through the daily 8ema and bounced us right off that red support line at 413.7. As of now that should still be considered support until proven other wise. 

Support for tomorrow of that line will be 414.6 meaning bulls need a small gap up overnight in order to reconfirm and hold that support with hopes of a push up to the 417/418 area. 

Now if this is the next leg down what bears need to do is break through 414.6 support and most importantly break under the daily 20ema and close a candle below it… If you remember we traded in that 410.2 to 413.9 range for almost 3 weeks before we finally broke out to 420… this actually is a back test of that support of that range. This is the bulls attempt to turn previous resistance into support.

Failing to do that would result in a retrace back to the 410 range. To really sell this market off bears need a closure under 410.2. That 410.2 level is our daily demand so that likely would be a major support bounce area for bulls. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 413 -> 418.8  
 Demand- 410.2  
 Support- 414.1 -> 412.3 -> 410.2  
 Resistance- 417.1 -> 418.6

Nearly identical movement from futes today setting a new supply at 4208. In doing this we would have expected the move down to the 4149/4143 supply area. We did come down and perfectly bounced off 4153. As of right now that is major support to watch. 

There is a chance overnight bears get this to 4149 to take out that supply but from here I expect a bounce off the daily 20ema. 

If bears continue their sell off though the biggest support will come at the 4127 demand.

Futures did not quite breakdown and touch that red support line that SPY did today. However, Futures did come down and perfectly back test and bounce off 4153 support form the previous 4122 to 4153 channel. 

We also are setting up to close exactly on the daily 20ema which would favor a possible double bottom support bounce and move back up. 

The most probable play out here is a double bottom off 4158 that leads to a move back up to the 4172 to 4188 area. 

However, if bears manage to break this down further then support is at 4125 if we see back to back selling off happen. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4149 -> 4208  
 Demand- 4128 -> 4198  
 Support- 4158 -> 4125

**QQQ Supply and Demand DAILY**

I said last week I was looking for a possible sell off back to the daily 8ema being that QQQ is in extreme bull momentum in order to find an opportunity for a long entry. We are looking to be getting just that. 

The daily officially turned 337.63 into a new supply… In doing so we come down and take out 337.29 and 333.11 supply. Now we do have another supply left down below at 326.82 but that is at the daily 20ema. That would be a larger sell off and with us being in extreme bull momentum I would be very surprised to see that move happen (not that it cant happen though). 

I will be looking for the bulls to bounce off the daily 8ema tomorrow and look for a run back to the 336.37 demand area. 

However, If this sell off continues then are most probable sell off target is that 326.82 supply which is also the daily 20ema. 325-326 is a pretty strong demand (Support) area that we would need more momentum to break through. 

QQQ Daily Levels  
 Supply- 337.6 -> 326.82 -> 322.31  
 Demand- 336.37 -> 325.99 -> 324.99

**VIX**

The VIX actually had a really nice breakout today and after bouncing off the 16 support area 3 days ago now this is now retesting critical resistance at 18.86. IF the bears (spy) can close the VIX over 18.86 and target 20.08 then I would believe in a bigger sell off on SPY happening. However, this is a probable rejection area for the VIX. Even if the VIX gets to 20.08 we still honestly are more likely to reject then we are to sell off…

There just isn’t any real momentum to the downside and even watching the intraday movement today the dip continues to get bought. 

With no debt ceiling talks till tomorrow minimum and FOMC minutes at 2pm we likely are to return to a slightly bullish narrative. There is a chance the market could bearishly take what JPOW had to say at FOMC but historically they usually receive FOMC minutes well not poorly.

Yellen is scheduled to talk at 1005am though so that could be a true wildcard. Tomorrow with Yellen and FOMC minutes is likely to be very volatile.

I really struggled this morning in that very tight range and chop… just seemed like premiums weren’t paying out for the move that was happening. However, was really able to capitalize on that mid day sell off and overall had a great day trading. Intraday secured another weeks of profit goal. Currently even if my QQQ and SPY Call lottos go to zero tomorrow I have officially secured 2.5x my weekly profit goal… if they don’t go to zero tomorrow then im sitting at 3x weekly profits goal. 

Currently assuming my week ends profitable this will be my 8th green week in a row… that makes it tied for my second longest win streak in a row… my longest current win streak (since I have started documenting the way I do now… remember I used to work full time as a nurse and just traded in my off times) is 10 weeks in a row of green. 

Just for transparency my longest red streak is 4 weeks in a row.**Come hang out with us on the NEW WallStreetBets[](https://twitter.com/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR) [Discord](https://discord.gg/wsbverse)!**

The company said advertisers would soon be able to run ads on its popular search engine that are created using generative AI

The software can spin up text and images from a simple prompt.

It will be able to draw on text from their product landing pages to create ads, and to automatically generate slogans and product descriptions that are more relevant to customer search queries.

Also, advertisers will be able to use AI-powered chat products for text and images as they create their ads. 

In newly introduced Product Studio, merchants can find product images with the help of generative AI “without the added cost of new photo shoots.”

Merchants will be able to improve the quality of low-resolution images, remove unwanted backgrounds, or add elements into a product image.

As tech giants such as Google and Microsoft Corp. race to weave generative AI into their products, some experts have expressed concern that the tools will be used to supercharge the torrent of misinformation circulating online. Google’s policies bar advertisers from misrepresenting the products and services they provide, and the company said the AI tools contain guardrails to prevent abuse. Ads created using generative AI will be subject to the company’s existing controls, but will not receive extra scrutiny, the company said.Comcast Corp. is introducing a $20-a-month streaming video package with more than 40 channels, as a cheaper TV service it will bundle with broadband to attract cord cutters.

Currently, they have approximately 540,000 subscribers, over 12,400 installed racks, and 1.1 million batteries in circulation. Their annual revenue amounts to around $400 million, primarily generated in Taiwan.

About a year ago, Gogoro became a public company through a SPAC listing. However, like many SPACs, Gogoro's share price has declined significantly from $10 to $3 (with a peak value of $17.59 right after listing). The trading volume per day is minimal.

The drop in valuation can be attributed, in part, to the challenges faced during Gogoro's initial expansion into China. Currently, the China network is being maintained by partner companies like Yadea, which have invested their own funds into the network. For Gogoro, this situation is relatively neutral as there are limited expectations for expansion, but also minimal costs associated with the existing network (less than 300 swapping stations).

Having learned from their experiences, Gogoro has shifted its strategy to focus on the B2B market in other international markets. The aim is to establish a strong network with B2B partners (Zypp Electric,  Globe Group, Ayala Corporation, Foodpanda, Gojek etc.) who can benefit from battery swapping compared to traditional charging. Following that, Gogoro plans to launch their offerings to B2C customers.

Based on close observation of the company, here is an overview of what can be expected in the short to mid-term:

**Introduction of new scooter models for international markets (Philippines, India, South Korea, etc.):**

* Expected timeline: mid-2023
* Manufactured in India
* Attractive price range: $1000-$1500 USD
* Sales to existing B2B partners as well as B2C customers (sales starting this year)
* Potential for export to Taiwan

**Release of new scooter models for the Taiwanese market:**

* Expected timeline: second half of 2023
* Focus on low-power category models, which are gaining popularity

**Expansion of Gogoro's Battery Swapping Network internationally:**

* Philippines: B2C network launch in Q4 of this year
* South Korea: Network expansion from 70 stations (used by B2B partners) to 200 by the end of this year (potential introduction of B2C scooters to early adopters)
* India: B2B network expansion in major cities this year
* Indonesia and Singapore: Planned expansions to follow
* China expansion will be put on hold, with a refocused emphasis on other countries

**Development of PBGN models by partners like Hero Motocorp:**

* Timetable: Models will be announced when the international battery swapping network is sufficiently established for B2C launch.

Success in international network expansions, coupled with positive reception of new scooter models, is expected to bring favorable outcomes. Scooter sales are anticipated to increase this year, generating international revenue. However, this year primarily focuses on building a solid foundation with B2B partners to facilitate accelerated expansion into the B2C market starting in 2024 and beyond.

Gogoro has given the following estimates for the market potential:Philippines = Taiwan market x 3India = Taiwan market x 100No estimate for Indonesia + South Korea + Singapore + Japan + Israel etc.

Gogoro's goal for 2023 is to generate 5-10% of their total revenue from international markets, which amounts to approximately $20-45 million based on their projected revenue of $400-450 million. No estimate yet from 2024 onwards.

What do you think? Will Gogoro succeed in their ambitious international expansion plans, or will they face significant challenges along the way? As investors, is it wise to take a risk and buy the stock now, or should we wait until we see concrete numbers in the balance sheet? Let's delve into the possibilities and examine the factors that may shape Gogoro's future.Spce is ready to go this thursday, check out the FAA page in the link. 
 	
Issue Date : 	May 23, 2023 at 1210 UTC
Location : 	TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, New Mexico
Beginning Date and Time : 	May 25, 2023 UTC 1400-2000 Daily
Ending Date and Time : 	May 26, 2023 UTC
Reason for NOTAM : 	TO PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR SPACECRAFT RECOVERY
Type : 	Space Operations
Replaced NOTAM(s) : 	N/AChevron Corp. announced Monday an agreement to buy Colorado-based oil and gas producer PDC Energy Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $6.3 billion, or $7.6 billion when including debt.

Under the terms of the deal, PDC shareholders will receive 0.4638 Chevron shares for each PDC share they own. Based on Friday's closing price for Chevron's stock of $155.23, the deal valued PDC shares at $72 each, a 10.6% premium to PDC's Friday closing price of $65.12.
-------

Based on the above, and today's price premarket. Chevron is at $152.44 premarket. 
PDC cost is $69.82, which devided by .4638, is $150.53.  Which is currently $1.90 over the cost benefit, to just buy Chevron.

But if we watch closely and put in limits at or below $70.70, some apes might come out with a few extra pennies.  🙉💰Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.Good morning all, providing an update on my short tech trade. Still holding, down around $3k after yesterday, you can see my cost per share after the call spread option assignments. Lots of people telling me to sell at open. Lots of support too. Even got a couple messages wishing me good luck. Didn’t know WSB could be such a supportive place. I’m looking for ZS $115 and SNOW $165 before I start scaling out. We’ll see what today brings. 
P.S. unrelated medical issue, both testicles seem to be swelling and growing in size since I made this trade, especially yesterday after market open when I didn’t sell (or didn’t buy is more accurate I guess since it’s a short position). Also have developed a sort of crystal Film over my balls, nothing can even seem to scratch it. Idk what it is, kind of looks like quartz. Idk. If you know what’s happening to me pls let me know.

I was wondering what you think about Turkey's risk of default. I am sure the likes of Dr. Michael Burry bought a lot of CDS' for Turkey.

Excerpts from a few sources:

"Despite extremely high inflation and unorthodox monetary policies, Turkey has so far avoided a systemic financial crisis. But its government's continued focus on near-term economic growth over long-term sustainability will increase the risk of the country entering such a crisis in 2023. Turkey's economy grew quickly in 2022 as the country emerged strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic and absorbed the initial shocks of Russia's war in Ukraine. But this brought with it soaring inflation (which hit an eyewatering 84% last month) and a deeply weakened currency (which has lost almost one-third of its value year-on-year). Unlike other countries that have responded to the post-COVID-19 and Ukraine-related surge in global commodity prices by tightening their monetary policies, Turkey has pursued monetary easing -- resorting to orthodox and unorthodox measures to slow the lira's depreciation, which has increased the financial burden of companies with foreign-currency debt. But while this unconventional strategy has..." (Stratfor)

Time to invest in Turkey CDS? Thoughts?With our illustrious leaders doing their usual song and dance about "its fixed,"  "its not fixed," and so forth, I am reminded to trade what I see, not what I think.

The knuckleheads in DC never do the right thing until they are forced to do so.  Even then they often find a way to mess it up. However, the government has been here before and even shut down.  All of this is theater.

Some context: since 2001, the debt ceiling has been raised 20 times.  But before you blame the current group of politicians, from 1960 - 2001, the debt ceiling has been raised 58 times.  

Simple math says, let's see, carry the 5, divide by 4, add a banana: 

Since 2001 the debt ceiling has been raised every 10.90.  

However, from 1960 - 2001 the debt ceiling was raised every 8.27 months.  So Boomers ARE in fact to blame for getting the ball rolling (and Nixon) - and Republicans btw (49 times) with Democrats (29) lagging.  However, since I have equal disdain for both, I DO count Obama's NON-Affordable Care Act as a HUGE increase in debt.

Anyway, I digress.

Let's take a look at past debt ceiling dramas - I have taken each timeframe and looked at the high of the market and then the lowest point DURING the debate, not the month prior:

&#x200B;

|Timeframe|SP 500 performance (HIGH to LOW)|
|:-|:-|
|July 2011 - August 2011|\-17%|
|Sept 19, 2013 - October 9, 2013|\-4.8%|
|Sept 2 2021 - October 4 2021|\-5.8%|

2011 was sort of an outlier since Europe was in shambles then so that added fuel to the fire.

Now lets look at the month FOLLOWING a deal; First the performance one month later and then the LOW to HIGH during the 30 months after; 2021 was a mess because of temporary measures etc, though,

&#x200B;

|Timeframe|One month after - LOW to +30d CLOSE|One month after LOW to HIGH|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Aug 9, 2011 - Sept 9, 2011|\+4.8%|\+11.7%|
|October 9 2013 - Nov 8 2913|\+7.5%|\+7.8%|
|October 4 - November 5, 2021|\+9.4%|\+9.4%|

So, since I believe the debt ceiling will get "fixed" what matters after its done is more important than during.

Obviously I am LONG the VIX, but as I have shared, I have many other reasons why I am positioned as such.

However, being the betting man I am, although this is a very small sample but it is correlative because it is during more "modern" market structure, I will be adding SPY and QQQ - maybe even 2xETFs Calls of each.

Yes, you read that right, I remain LONG VIX (Aug-Oct) and will get LONG SPY (AUG) and LONG QQQ (AUG).

Before you inundate me with how can I be long SPY and VIX?  Bc I believe the debt deal will get done sooner and I still believe the house of cards, or part of the house, will come crumbling down by AUG-OCT and I am prepared to roll.  I remain heavily long VIX but am flat to slightly up = thankyou long dated options.

Thank you..

https://i.redd.it/8p4nyrp08i1b1.gifThis calculation determines the sensitivity of time until retirement as a function of market return and savings rate. Time until financial independence is plotted as a function of market return and saving rate. With a hypothetical market return of 0 percent, the time until retirement varies significantly as a function of saving rate, varying from 37.5 yrs with a 5 percent saving rate to 10 years with a 50 percent saving rate. As the market return increases, the sensitivity of time to retirement with respect to variation in savings rate decreases. At a market return rate of 15 percent, a 5 percent savings rate would take 10 years to retire and a 50 percent savings rate would take 7 years to retire. Regardless of the market return, the impact of bosting savings rate is most impactful when increasing from small values with somewhat diminishing returns at higher savings rates. 

The simulation parameters are annotated on the figure, with all dollar values normalized to salary. The calculation assumes a 4 percent withdraw rate.I had been rising a ton over the past couple of days. I have looked all over but can’t find any recent news about them, just miscellaneous things about the company. Does anybody know what’s going on? I really can’t find anything for the life of me.The Federal Reserve's 2023 report titled "[Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2022](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2022-report-economic-well-being-us-households-202305.pdf)" provides a snapshot of American households' financial conditions. My key takeaway from this in-depth examination is a worrisome trend of declining financial well-being coupled with rising anxieties over future financial security, particularly regarding retirement savings. Despite these uncertainties, the report depicts a robust labor market and pervasive banking and credit services access. However, issues persist in areas such as housing affordability and the perceived value of education against its cost. The data further underscores the significant influence of broader economic conditions, such as inflation and market volatility, on households' financial status. Overall, the insights gathered from this report offer a critical perspective on the challenges and realities shaping America's economic landscape.

Here are some key takeaways from the report:

1. **The Decline in Financial Well-being**: The report indicates a decline in people's financial well-being over the previous year. Self-reported financial well-being fell sharply and was among the lowest observed since 2016. The share of adults who said that they spent less than their income in the month before the survey fell in 2022 from the prior year, while the share said that their credit card debt increased.
2. **Concerns about Future Financial Security**: Among adults who were not retired, the survey showed a decline in the share who felt that their retirement savings plan was on track, suggesting that individuals had concerns about their future financial security.
3. **Impact of Broader Economic Conditions**: The financial well-being declines across these measures indicate how families were affected by broader economic conditions in 2022, such as inflation and stock market declines.
4. **Labor Market Strength**: Despite concerns about rising prices and their ability to build savings, the survey results indicated continued labor market strength in late 2022. The share of adults who voluntarily quit asked for a raise or received a raise increased slightly over the prior year's survey, reflecting the strong labor market.
5. **Banking and Credit**: Access to financial services from banks and credit unions remained high. In 2022, 94 percent of adults had a bank account, although notable gaps remain by income, age, race, ethnicity, and disability status.
6. **Housing and Rent**: Nearly two-thirds of renters said their inability to afford a down payment to buy a home was why they rent—seventeen percent of renters needed to catch up on their rent at some point in the prior year.
7. **Education and Student Loans**: More than two-thirds of adults with a bachelor's degree or more said the financial benefits of their education exceeded the cost. However, a lower 3 in 10 of those who started but still needed to complete at least an associate degree shared this view.
8. **Retirement and Investments**: Progress toward retirement savings goals declined in 2022. Thirty-one percent of non-retirees thought their retirement savings plan was on track, down from 40 percent in 2021.A few days ago, I put a post regarding upstart’s potential. Nobody believed in my story. Today I am just putting a picture of my returns. Not a huge $ return but there is long way to go.I think we should just have a national campaign where IRS agents go door-to-door and overturn everyone's couch cushions. Who knows how much money we could find? Maybe you'll find $10, maybe you'll find $1.05, maybe nothing, but the times you find a $100 bill should offset that.

Recent studies show that Americans have a couch for about six years and they usually contain at least $1.55 in change at any given time. That is good odds. How many couches are in the US right now? Jaime, pull that up. There's 123.6 million housholds in the US. That means we're missing out on at least a 1.9 million dollar budget shortfall on American couches.

Then we can expand this to include money under car seats, money in center consoles, money on unspent gift cards. The IRS could include gift card searches in thier searches and if they find a gift card close to expiration you can deduct it as a tax credit and they can use it to pay government workers, that way they get meals and they don't get as hurt by inflation at the grocer.

Think of all the gas stations where you don't pick up the penny on the ground when you walk by. There are at least 145,000 gas stations in the US, if each one has an uncollected penny that's at least $1450! That's not including the take-a-penny-leave-a-penny dishes. I don't know about you guys, but when I go into a gas station I take the pennies and no one has ever stopped me. I have made at least $2 so far doing this. If every IRS agent does that it world 10x the uncollected-gas-station-penny initiative.

Don't even get me started on water fountains. Does anyone else have any good ideas where we can find missing revenue?
Think there may still be some room to run up tomorrow morning which is where I would slowly scale in more (10-15 contracts per .~3%). Twitter heads turning bullish calling for 4300. 

Think we see a spike in vix and a solid 1.5-2% drop on spy within the week. Leaning towards it happening Thursday. 

Position: 50x SPY 417 06/02 putsI have 6/16 $410 SPY puts that just evaporate every day. Breakeven is like $404 or something. Nothing will turn this stupid ass market red. Then in the moment it turns red, some idiot buys it up and turns it green again. Talk of war, defaulting, increasing interest rates. Nope, none of it matters. Just goes green. 

I would love to see a -3% day. I don’t know why people here don’t want a crashed market. Don’t you want a chance to pick up some stocks that aren’t over valued? 

I can’t be the only one.Well todays volatility was presented by the debt ceiling… its actually interesting to me and it shows a lot of the strength of this rally by the fact that SPY can drop $2 in a shot period of time and then immediately recover… this still very much so is a buy the dip market. 

Any sell off its likely to be short term for now. I think there will come a time where that changes but for now over reactions and big drops should be seen as buying opportunities.

If you didn’t see the news about a fake pentagon attack that also dumped SPY and the markets with it…. Here it is… honestly its wild to think that something like this can even happen in modern day trading. Again I am one that does not really like to say manipulation and claim there a higher power holding the little man down… but that’s legit insane that 500 billion market cap can be wiped out like that on a completely fake and bogus image. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

No major changes here on SPY S/D… biggest thing is that we are still clearly rejecting that 419.5 supply. Until we put in a new supply though (resistance) we should consider the upside as the favor. IF and when we put in a new supply then we will start to look for the slew of supplies from 413.05 to 416.75 to be taken out.

The bulls for a second saw 420 again before it was absolutely blasted down EOD. That 419.5 continues to be a strong resistance here and that is what we will look for tomorrow. We did come down and double bottom off 418.6, however, this doji we really could go either way. For now with SPY weekly in extreme bull momentum and the daily attempting to break back into that momentum the daily 8ema should be considered strong support and should be considered a take profit for shorts and a potential entry for a long. 

Spy Daily Levels  
 Supply- 419.5 -> 416.8 -> 415.6  
 Demand- 410.2  
 Support- 418.6 -> 416.9 -> 414.8  
 Resistance- 420.2 -> 422.1

Now futures actually shows a different story but in the end the results and expectations remains the same… on futures we actually established a new supply at 4216. In doing so we came back down and took out previous supply at 4191 today. However, the major difference here is that we established a new 4198 demand. In doing this the favoritism remains the upside much like SPY… however, the reasoning for why we expect upside differs. 

I will say that both SPY and Futes are nearing some very overbought territory and nearing a new DMI daily wave down. But like I said we are in extreme bull momentum so realistically daily 8ema should be considered support.

Looking at futures daily here it actually looks a little more toppy then SPY does. That 4216 is becoming really stout resistance and for the 3rd day in a row bulls have failed to close over it. However, as you see we came down and bounced right off the daily 8ema support. 

I am bullish until we close the 8ema support. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4216 ->4311

Now I actually was watching this very closely EOD as I almost opened a short position with a target of 333. There was a moment EOD where it looked like we were going to get a really nice 337.3 rejection and resistance. This would then negated putting a new demand being put in… however, the bulls closed out a bullish engulfing daily candle and put in a new 336.37 demand. 

In doing so and closing over 337.29 they open up the potential for a move back to that 347.11 supply. However, as you can see that yellow resistance line does have 3 touches and holds. 339.1 will be that key resistance for tomorrow at the yellow line. 

QQQ Daily Levels  
 Supply- 347.1 -> 337.3 -> 333.1  
 Demand- 336.4 -> 326

Now the VIX still has failed to break out and can not seem to hold that 17.97 resistance area once it touches it. However, we have now retaken that key 16.92 support area. This doji candle failed breakout would signal a drop on the VIX tomorrow and move up on SPY tomorrow. 

Now the weirdest thing about today? The fact that SPY, VIX , 10YR Yield and DXY all closed green… that is not something you see every day…

I unfortunately woke up with a 101 degree fever this morning and have not been feeling the best all day today…. However, I was able to play some absolutely banger wins today. I was blessed to be on the right side of that huge 10am wick down and was able to close almost right at the bottom. 

Overall for a Monday today was a great day and I closed out my day being almost 2x my weekly profits. Definitely a great start to the week!**Come hang out with us on the NEW WallStreetBets[](https://twitter.com/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR) [Discord](https://discord.gg/wsbverse)!**

I will never sell, in fact, I will only add to my position in Tesla until I can afford to finally afford the Triple Stack Baconator.1. There has been a sharp **fall in volatility**. The average difference between the S&P 500 index's daily highs and lows in April-May fell to 38.66 points (less than 1%). That figure had been 1.5 times higher in Q1, and it was twice as high in 2022. The last time this range was so low was in November 2021, at the tail end of a bull market rise and just a month before the markets reached their all-time high.
2. Heavyweights are propping up the major indexes while small caps lag. **Apple's market cap surpassed the entire Russell 2000 index's market cap** in late April and has remained higher ever since. The Russell 2000 has grown just 2% this year, while Apple has surged 34%.
3. The **divergence** could signal an impending recession. Small cap companies are more vulnerable during economic slowdowns and rate hikes. This vulnerability is reflected not only in financial indicators, but also in investor positioning, with a preference for stability.

Even if the debt ceiling issue resolves smoothly and some short-term risks recede, that still won't ensure sustained stock growth.

Basically is there anything we can see now that suggests that could fall behind. It doesn’t have to be as bad as blackberry or as dramatic as boeing, but maybe something like AMD’s commitment to multi core chips or intel’s drop to parity.Got a hard $ON for new SiC technology.

In the words of Anakin, “I hate sand”Thats what seems to be happening. So many of these stocks are just today coming out of or bouncing off oversold territory. I can see the market continue to move up as large caps now go sideways and focus turns to growth sector. Any thoughts?This morning, an AI generated image of an explosion at the US Pentagon surfaced. With multiple news sources reporting it as real, the S&P 500 fell 30 points in minutes.

This resulted in a $500 billion market cap swing on a fake image. It then rebounded once the image was confirmed fake.

Apes and AI, a match made in heaven.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-26.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean "cheaper." High numbers mean "expensive." A 1 means "fairly" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have "weeklies", the underlying is "too cheap", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.
* **How should this be improved?** Do you have any suggestions or notice any bugs with this report?The "writing is on the wall" - Erdogan is expected to be reelected as the leader of Turkey in a run-off election to be held on May 28th. As a result, the Turkish stock market has already resumed its downward slide and could fall another 25-30% from its current value once the result of the Turkish election is confirmed.

What, if any, results will the Turkish elections have on the U.S. markets is unknown. But given the U.S. is only 9 days away from debt default, dark clouds are looming. However, pundits believe that a U.S. default cannot and will never happen.

Stay tuned.

Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.**Come hang out with us on the NEW WallStreetBets[](https://twitter.com/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR) [Discord](https://discord.gg/wsbverse)!**

Check out our [Earnings Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13m2tfd/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/) and [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/contentguide).I let my options from Friday’s expiration assign, resulting in a $90k combined short position on SNOW and ZS. That’s nearly half the value of my account. Have I come to the right place?

Needless to say, I didn’t sleep all weekend.Virgin Galactic targets May 25 for first spaceflight since Richard Branson's trip https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/05/17/virgin-galactic-targets-may-25-for-first-spaceflight-since-branson.htmlI recently met up with someone who had just come from China recently. I never thought about it but China doesn't allow the use of ChatGPT and are still currently in the midst of creating their own state run AI model. Without such a big moat where every company and their degenerate nephew on WSB is talking about how great their "proprietary AI" is doing, I think this could be a big deterrent for countries that don't allow for AI. 

&#x200B;

In other words, how should I short these countries and how many puts should I buy?I used to come on here all the time trying to talk some sense into you regards. This is the last time I'm going to try to help you monkeys save yourselves from yourselves. From here on out I'm just going to laugh at you fucking regards wreck your lives with greed. After this I'm going to drive out to $COST and buy a giant sack of Kosher salt so I can rub it deep inside your wounds when you present them. 

**1:You regards wouldn't know what good advice was if you read it**

One of the most common complaints I see right after one of you regards blows your rent money on 0 DTE call options in the middle of a bear setup or vice versa is, "Why don't successful traders share their knowledge."   
Successful traders do share their advice. Often, it comes for free. But you're too fucking stupid to recognize good trading advice when you see it. Before you get scammed by shysters selling you $1,000 systems and $20 Discord group subscriptions just to tell you bullshit like "the trend is your friend", I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in: Jesse, Warren, Soros and Bury, Mesiler from Real Money, Amrit Sall and Peter. 

1: George Soros - This motherfucker is so good at trading that Joe Rogan actually started spewing that antisemitic trope that Jews are trying to control the world on his podcast. I know you fucking monkeys can't read, but on the off chance one of you has two brain cells left after that Wendy's shift, give some guy a handy by the dumpster and take the bus to Barnes and Noble and pick up a copy of *The Alchemy of Finance* with your sex money. Soros just fucking gives away trading strategies in that book. 

2: Jesse Livermore - The OG. Read the book about him called "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator". Livermore is the king of "This has all happened before, this will all happen again." He describes how the strategies he used were used in the 1850's and then in his time in the early 1900's, and I'm finding that most of what he says still works. 

3: Warren Buffet - He literally explains all of his major trading decisions every god damn year in one of the biggest finance events of the year. 

4: Michael Burry - Genius levels of spectrum intelligence. This man has deleted more brilliant tweets than I have taken shits. 

5: Helene Meisler - Brillaint fucking chart technician. She is all over podcasts and Twitter including two episodes of Odd Lots. 

I know a lot of you are going to say, "BUT I FOLLOW DEM WHY NO TENDIES!"   


You're a fucking moron, that's why. 

**2: Trading On Fundamentals Works**

Just keep your fucking eyes and ears open. Be observant. It can be as simple as tracking what you're paying in gas for your car.   
Better yet, listen to conference calls. Publicly traded companies have a mild legal obligation to tell you the truth, and can get in trouble for misleading investors. So, go listen to what they have to say. You know who doesn't have to tell you the truth? Anyone on CNB FUCKING C. 

One of the best trades I made was because it was the month I I decided to start listening to earnings calls. During a call, [CVX outlined a baseline $75 oil price](https://www.chevron.com/investors/events-presentations). I watched oil prices and the moment I saw oil climb above $75 I knew oil companies were going to go gangbusters. 

Listen to the conference calls. Listen to what the bankers care about. Also, get to know who the bankers are from and where they work. You'll start to be able to guess where big money is going to move next, and be able to watch out for signs of those shifts in the charts.   
Remember, conference calls are a poker game. If you have any people reading skills, you'll do well. 

**3: Technical Analysis Works,**   


But you're shit at TA and so it won't work for you. But let me try to help you. Again, I know how hard this undertaking is, but I tend to run into, not away from difficult situations for the challenge. 

The biggest critics of Technical Analysis accuse technicians of not being able to predict stock prices. A lot of people say things like "Ahhh hhahahahahaha, squiggly lines don't work. Hahaha. Get rekt! 

You don't draw the line and expect the price to do what the line says, fuckwit. You draw a line and use it to determine if the stock is doing what it is supposed to do. For example, I bought into $BABA a while back because if we were going to get a spike back to the 100's, the price probably wouldn't fall much below that purple line.   


https://preview.redd.it/3eobjixuy91b1.jpg?width=673&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18b4121d149c1b4510da0404a2b8e8105f142291

If BABA fell below the purple line and stayed there for a few trading sessions I would have killed the position. It didn't. I got the pop. I sold, and took money from /r/BABA. 

Why Technical Analysis Works  
Technical analysis is nothing more than human psychology expressed as a graph of stock price over time. If we accept that humans are ultimately what moves a stock price, then we should see things like greed, fear, panic, and uncertainty. Each of these human emotions has a chart pattern associated with it. Stare at some charts. Learn what panic looks like, learn what greed looks like. I have included 3 charts, one for uncertainty, fear, and greed that explains how to spot both of those.

Other Uses for TA  
1: Determine if there is a gap between reality and stock prices. For example, on my oil trade in 2021 and 2022 I noticed there had not been a bull run in energy stocks despite a bull run in oil. I had a feeling oil stocks would eventually catch up with oil, so I bought some shares and leaps.  

2: Reduce Risk - TA can help you find ideal entry and exit points. I know monkeys don't like planning, but using TA you can plan entries and exits in advance. I tend to enter trades at or near key resistance levels and set my stops just below those levels. 

3: Determine Market Sentiment  
I use price and volume to determine market sentiment. One of the problems that plagues new traders is price not reflecting news. They are often bearish when they should be bullish and vice versa. I have included pictures of what uncertainty, greed, and panic look like in the market. When we're going Up volume is falling, when we're going down volume is rising. It's damn near as simple as that. Don't try to make it more complicated than that with Okonomiyaki Clouds or bullshit like that, at least not until you have the basics down. 

Often the news will be super bullish or super bearish and incredibly wrong. You regards especially are wrong and I've taken so many "time to switch from bull to bear" cues from you regards I almost feel like I owe you money. But the charts don't lie. News is bearish? Look for rising volume to confirm. News is bullish? Look for falling volume to confirm.   
Tell ya what, I'll be sporting. If you catch me by a Wedny's dumpster, I'll tip after the handy. Deal? And thanks for your help. 

4: Combine Technical and Fundamental Analysis

I personally combine the two. If I could only use charts or fundamentals, I would choose charts. I don't think I'd be as good, but I think I'd be just fine. 

**5:** **For the Love of God, You Goddamned Monkeys Stop YOLO'ing Everything**

Or Do, I don't give a shit anymore. 

Okay. I gave you all the basics. The rest is on you. I'm just coming back for the LOLZ from now on because you idiots keep downvoting me when I post correct information. That's fine. I'm sure plenty a zookeeper has been hit with flung feces.

The trader I look up to is George Soros. I fucking love him as a trader. He trades exactly the way I want to trade someday: with billions of dollars. My favorite quote of his is "You call that a position?" when he was dressing down Ray Dalio for not risking enough.   


I have studied Soros, what he did, how he did it, why he did it. It's amazing. It's incredible It's beautiful.> Stocks are extremely overvalued. 

>  These investors use their returns over the past five years as proof that their methodology has merit when simple common sense shows that you can’t possibly be an investor while denying the definition of an “investment,”

> Buying stocks or bonds today provide neither “safety of principal” nor “adequate return.” In fact, these “price-insensitive buyers” don’t even attempt to begin any sort of “thorough analysis.” For this reason they are nothing more than speculators.

Very insightful analysis.

Written 2015-05-13 when the Nasdaq Composite was at 3,500I run into this chart online and it made me realize that data centers are a way bigger portion of revenues than I initially thought. I was planning on buying puts before earnings give the recent hype, thinking that AI is not going to replace lost revenue due to gaming (especially after reading articles like this: https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/25/23697649/microsoft-q3-2023-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface), but it might be able to cover it given that data centers is such a big portion of the business.**Come hang out with us on the NEW WallStreetBets[](https://twitter.com/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR) [Discord](https://discord.gg/wsbverse)!**

Check out our [Earnings Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13m2tfd/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/) and [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/contentguide). DM the [mod inbox/sex line](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets)  I'm back with an even more detailed look at my VIX trading strategy that led me to $375,000 in profits. Thanks to your insightful comments, I've further refined my strategy and uncovered additional patterns from my dataset, which spans 16 years of market data. Let's dive deeper into the analysis and explore the enhanced strategy!

**The Data**

As a reminder, I analyzed 16 years of VIX, SPX, and market indicators data from 2005 to 2021. The dataset included:

· Daily VIX and SPX closing prices

· Gamma highs and lows

· 50, 100, and 200-day moving averages

· Moon phases (full moon and new moon dates)

**Key Insights and Revisions**

With your comments in mind, I revisited the dataset and discovered even more fascinating patterns that further strengthened my strategy:

1. From 2005 to 2021, on average, the VIX increased by 3.57% during new moons and decreased by 2.81% during full moons. This trend persisted across various market conditions and reinforced my decision to use moon phases in my trading strategy. As [u/5JeepHardRock](https://www.reddit.com/u/5JeepHardRock/) pointed out, full moons occur approximately every 29.5 days, which helped me better time my trades.

2. The inverse relationship between the VIX and SPX was particularly strong during significant market events. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the VIX reached an all-time high of 80.86, while the SPX plummeted by more than 50%. This insight was crucial in helping me identify opportunities to short the SPX and buy VIX call options.

3. In the 16-year dataset, there were 27 instances where the Gamma spread was above 85. In 22 of these instances (81.48%), the VIX experienced a decline within the next 3 to 5 trading days, providing a perfect setup for my Thunder Call spreads.

4. Bullish markets saw an average VIX decline of 4.92% when the 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average. This pattern helped me time my Thunder Put trades to capitalize on potential market reversals.

5. As [u/Winter-Efficiency598](https://www.reddit.com/u/Winter-Efficiency598/) mentioned, I didn't make any significant gains in 2021. This is because the VIX was essentially flat during that year. However, I consider it a win, as my strategy helped me avoid unnecessary trades and potential losses in a volatile market.

**The Enhanced Strategy**

With the newfound insights and revisions, I've refined my initial strategy as follows:

1. During new moons, I shorted the SPX and bought VIX call options.

2. During full moons, I engaged in long puts on the VIX (Lightning Puts).

3. If a full moon occurred and the Gamma spread was 85 or higher, I entered a Thunder Call spread.

4. In bullish markets, I timed my Thunder Put trades to coincide with the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.

5. In periods of low VIX movement, such as 2021, I exercised patience and avoided unnecessary trades.

**Further Opportunities**

[u/Comicdn](https://www.reddit.com/u/Comicdn/) and [u/Affectionate\_Fix8401](https://www.reddit.com/u/Affectionate_Fix8401/) suggested that I could also explore potential squeeze/pump plays alongside my complex options trading. This is an excellent idea that could potentially boost my profits even further. I plan to delve into this area and share my findings with you all soon.

**Final Thoughts**

The more data you have, the better equipped you are to make informed trading decisions. By analyzing 16 years of VIX, SPX, and market indicators data, I was able to create a robust strategy that led me to a $375,000 profit. Your comments and feedback have been invaluable in refining and enhancing my approach.

Remember, investing is a journey of constant learning and adaptation. Be open to new ideas and strategies, and always strive to improve your understanding of the markets. Thank you all for your insights, and I look forward to continuing this conversation and learning from each other.

Good luck, and happy trading!

P.S. As for the Jugo ETF idea from [u/Winter-Efficiency598](https://www.reddit.com/u/Winter-Efficiency598/), who knows? Maybe one day, we can all collaborate to launch it together.

Edit to the original post:

Update: Some people have mentioned that they think I'm joking because of the funny names I've used for my strategies. Let me clarify my approach.

To keep things straight, I come up with memorable names for my findings and then use data science to validate my hypotheses. If a hypothesis fails, I set it aside in case I can use a portion of it within another strategy or as a precursor. I like to think of strategies as switches in a house. You need to have multiple switches, but if they're all on, you're being wasteful. If you only have one on, you can't see clearly. The goal is to have a few on for the room you're in, setting the right vibe.

In other words, each strategy is not always engaged. They all have their own on/off switches and dimmers, as well as a master kill switch and a full-house surge protector. This approach allows me to adapt and optimize my trading strategies based on current market conditions.

"We stay invested but cautious as a result" is the common theme. And that's why stock won't fall, because everyone is bearish but no one wants to sell. 

# Market-moving News

**Inflation and the Fed: It was a quiet week for inflation data, but there was a lot of hawkish talk from Fed members.** Consumer spending on services, particularly travel, showed a decline, and overall spending remained on a downward trend. Bank of America (BoA) card data indicated a larger decrease in travel spending compared to the previous month. However, April's core retail sales (excluding automobiles and gas) were higher than expected, driven by restaurant and online purchases. BAC credit and debit card data revealed that consumers have been trading down and spending more at value grocery stores to cope with inflation. Overall, consumers' financial health remains strong, but delinquency rates increased in Q1. The frequency of CEOs mentioning "inflation" during earnings calls reached a one-and-a-half-year low. Most Fed members who spoke this week had a hawkish stance, increasing the probability of a June interest rate hike to over 40% on Thursday. However, the market was calmed by remarks from JP, bringing the probability back down to 20% on Friday.

**The Leading Economic Index (LEI) reached a new low, but industrial output rebounded more than expected. The GDPNow model predicts a 2.9% growth for Q2, indicating no sign of a recession yet.** Economic data this week showed mixed results. Although the LEI dropped in April, the decline was smaller than the previous month. The overall the indicator still pointed to a mild recession in Q3. The housing market, including homebuilder sentiment, starts, permits, sales, and prices, appears to have stabilized, which is a positive sign for the economy. US industrial production unexpectedly increased in April, particularly in auto production, which is a strong economic signal and could potentially address the issue of record low inventory nationwide. The US job market remains healthy and tight, with jobless claims lower than estimated last week. Global economic growth remains sluggish, with both EU and Chinese industrial output falling short of expectations.

[Summary of economic data](https://preview.redd.it/royqlirv831b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6bde1af4d2eda069a3be335e8a5a56ce29b34fbc)

US business and markets: The number of companies mentioning "recession" during earnings calls has reached a one-year low. In Q1 earnings calls, 107 companies cited "recession," which is higher than the 5-year average of 77 and the 10-year average of 59. However, this number has declined for the third consecutive quarter after peaking in Q2 2022. In terms of sectors, information technology and healthcare seem to be the least concerned about a recession. There has been increased discussion about the debt ceiling, but the stock market has remained relatively stable without much volatility. The bond market experienced a significant sell-off, leading to the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond reaching its highest level in over two months. This sell-off is likely due to hawkish talks from the Federal Reserve rather than concerns about the debt ceiling.

The S&P 500 posted a 1.6% gain for the week, breaking free from a narrow range it had been stuck in since April. Mega-cap stocks once again outperformed their value counterparts, maintaining growth equity's strong performance this year. Earnings reports from major consumer-related companies painted a gloomy picture of consumer spending. Both Home Depot and Target provided full-year guidance below market expectations. However, Walmart provided a silver lining as it benefited from consumer trade-downs. The company cited gains in groceries and increased store visits from budget-conscious affluent consumers. During economic downturns, weak household consumption often stems from consumers reducing their debt levels. However, debt payment levels today remain well below historical averages, suggesting that while household consumption may slow, a significant contraction is not expected in the near future. As consumer spending is 70% of GDP, a deep recession is still unlikely.

# My positions and predictions

**US Equity Valuation**

Analysts’ estimations:

2023 Full Year EPS: $220 (down from $221 last week)

NTM EPS: $230 (unchanged from last week)

2024 Full Year EPS: $246 (down from $247 last week)

Current forward PE: 18.3 (up from 18.0 last week), lower than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3.

My investment thesis has not changed. Stock price is too high due to low risk premium:

https://preview.redd.it/m48p9zdu931b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9a53379c95ef1472172f33dc77ddf653b33a576d

If we evaluate SP500 based on risk premium (10-year average at 3%), stock today should have a forward PE of 15.4, and given NTM EPS is $230 and 2024 EPS is $247, SPX should be at 3542 today and 3804 by year end (might be higher since T-bill yield is probably lower at year end).

**My year-end projection (not changed):**

My base case (shown in green) has not changed from last week. Assume SP500 earnings of $247 for 2024, with inflation stabilizing under 4% and continuing to decline. The Fed pause after May hike and keep rate unchanged until year-end, before starting to cut in 2024. Year-end target is between 3920 to 4410 for SP500 based on 16-18X forward PE ratio.

Light blue box is where we are today. If we use 10-yr average forward PE ratio (17X), 3900 is a more appropriate level, and if we use risk premium model, we should be close to 3600.

If the current "Goldilocks" situation persists, characterized by a resilient economy and consumers, along with inflation reaching 3% by year-end, small- and mid-cap stocks, particularly those in the Small Growth style, could present an interesting investment opportunity. These stocks are currently trading at attractive valuations and tend to perform well in a slow expansion environment with low interest rates.

**I am not a licensed broker or advisor. These are not financial advises just my personal opinion. Please manage your risk when trading.**Trucking is a predicting indicator of future economics. Truckers are taking any goods they can right now due to low trucking demand. 

Lowest trucking demand since 2019I am currently in Pharming Group it is listed on Euronext and as an ADR on the NASDAQ. When I bought the stock it was making about 200 million in revenue. It only had one profitable medicine. End of 2019 the price peaked at 1.61 EUR.

Yet now the outlook has massively improved. There is a second medicine on the market. Which will bring in an expected additional peak yearly revenue of about 200-300 million. At best probably somewhere 500 million. The P&L will only improve the next few quarters. 

Yet, if the outlook is so great, why (the fck) is the share price currently only 1.61. Every so-called analyst is expecting double digit % returns, some going  so far as expecting the share price to quadruple. Yet the price is not doing a damn thing. 

I feel like the mid cap market (500M+) is rigged. Why is nobody noticing? Can the price be artificially be kept down??? This stock seems to defy all my knowledge about healthy stock-movements... Why is it like this?Assuming inflation was hiding in the stock market due to individuals and firms holding and buy stock with near 0% interest rate. The most recent downward trend, maybe ending.  The question I have for y’all is, once the debt debate is concluded will we be looking at a stock run like we saw after the 2001 recession? Are we returning to the bill bear cycle of the 90’s and the 2000’s?

Looking at historical trends. Prices are similar to the early 2000’s with similar federal funds and mortgage rates.There are no hard rules in trading but after reading one too many problem threads I have to say that you filth disgust me.  
I dont care if you yolo your entire life savings on one 0DTE, terrible risk management but hey its your life and you might even get lucky. We are all gambling troglodytes here.

Where I draw the line is:

Rule#1 NEVER BORROW MONEY

Rule#2 DONT FORGET RULE 1

If you are not making money you must NEVER borrow money to trade. No exceptions. You weren't making money with $100, $1000, your fucking life savings and your not going to with whoever you borrow from.

Atleast when you yolo your life savings away, you can actually crawl your ass back by eating cup noodles and asking people if they want to upsize. But fucking yourself with interest can literally be mathematically unrecoverable.

Lately I have been reading way too many shit stories of people borrowing money from family, friends, gf, credit card, student loan whatever. This is the most despicable thing you could do, you are literally sub human if you do this. You already know your a fucking loser who cant make money and deep down you know you just stole their money, countless hours of their work and lit it on fire because you had no morals or self control.

Rule#1 NEVER BORROW MONEY

Rule#2 DONT FORGET RULE 11) Here are the brief stats on Home Depot Earnings Report

YOY Revenue % decline: 4.2%

YOY Net income % decline: 8.5%

YOY EPS % decline: 6.6%

2) Guidance: they mentioned full 2023 EPS was expected to be down 7 to 13% of 2022 EPS

3) Home Depot cited declining lumber prices as a reason for its revenue decline. Here is an image to show how lumber prices have fallen: [https://i.postimg.cc/J7gQN7zD/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/J7gQN7zD/image.png)

The units are USD per 1000 Board ft

Generally, when lumber prices fall, it's a sign of poor economic health. When looking at lumber companies, some have mentioned a decline in single-family starts as a reason for their decline in revenue. Companies like Boise Cascade have reported revenue declines of 34% YOY and companies like Weyerhauser reported a 71% decline in revenue YOY.

4) The Spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HMLqinyubF6y86myAXXM0TJpJOEOSJtC3wH5QOWa3qw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HMLqinyubF6y86myAXXM0TJpJOEOSJtC3wH5QOWa3qw/edit?usp=sharing)

In this spreadsheet, the first tab shows historic quarterly revenue and the %yoy increase or decrease. Here you can see that there are really only a few years where Home Depot reported a negative quarter YOY decline

To the right, I have TTM and FEPS. TTM stands for trailing 12 months which is the 4 most recent quarters of EPS added together. FEPS stands for Forward EPS which I was able to calculate using their 2023 EPS guidance. For this calculation, I multiplied 2022 EPS by 90% to represent the mid between the 7% to 13% decline in EPS for this year.

Historic EPS on the conservative side tends to be around 15 to 17 as found on MACRO Trends. Currently, we are around 17 PE using TTM EPS. Using FEPS, we are around 19 PE. Personally, I think we're a bit overpriced. Below that, I show the current dividend yield. In the Next tab over, I show their dividend history and how their dividend has grown over time. Home Depot is really well known for its amazing dividend growth. 

I forecast different price points based on either PE multiples or technical supports and show what dividend yield will look like currently, 1 year out, and 2 years out assuming a 10% yearly dividend growth forecast.

Here are the technicals for HD to go along with the spreadsheet: [https://i.postimg.cc/mDK8gTcH/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mDK8gTcH/image.png)

The blue line is an anchored VWAP from the all-time highs.

If you are interested in Home Depot stock, this may help you decide where fair value is and what your future dividend gains may look like. Also keep in mind if we see another housing boom with interest rate cuts, companies like Home Depot are likely to benefit yet again.

Hope you all enjoyed\~Republicans

Work requirements for entitlements – food stamps, Medicaid, etc.

Reduce spending and slow government spending to 1% growth (this is a no-go for the White House)

Recoup money aimed at pending recovery (White House agrees)

Reform and streamline infrastructure spending (possible agreement with White House) – basically making it easier but possibly more risky to build infrastructure

Democrats are aiming at raising the debt ceiling without giving in to too many Republican changes to the nation’s budget and spending

These only a handful of negotiation points. There is also a much larger topic that is remaining under the radar – student loan payments to resume collection. This, imo, is probably the largest risk to markets and the economy aside from failing to reach a deal on easing the debt limit. 

There is currently $1.635 trillion is outstanding federal student loan debt and repayment of student loans has been repeatedly paused and delayed. What happens when suddenly everyone has to begin paying off their student loans again? That’s a lot of money being redirected to paying off student loans rather consumer goods. This will cause a huge slowdown in consumer spending – hence the repeated pauses and reluctance to begin forcing everyone to pay off their loans. 

Also, republicans are pushing for rate cuts wherever they can get them – meaning less money for government spending. Less money for programs such as the CHIPS act giving semiconductor manufacturers $50bn of taxpayer money to “compete” with other superpowers. 

Markets have rallied, at least according to financial propaganda, because both republicans and democrats are negotiating for a deal and it appears likely the debt ceiling will be raised by the deadline. This is absolute garbage – raising the debt ceiling is NOT itself bullish. We don’t even know the details of changes to come when a deal is reached and  the debt ceiling is inevitably raised. 

This is a classic buy the rumor sell the news.

Use these like any indicator, with caution. Basically gives you an understanding of when we start going into oversold or overbought territories.

1. This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.
2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations.
3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 & 2 that I made. You can have overbought + high RSI on individual tickers like MSFT and NVDA because of something that may fundamentally change the company like a new revenue stream. Hence why this is more useful on index-related products.
4. At the end of the day, this is all a game of probability. When you are oversold on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the upside. When you are overbought on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the downside.Hey Reddit!

# Background

Scientific and technological advancements have led to an increasing reliance on advanced machines in our daily lives, making us more dependent on them. Whether it's communication, connectivity, transportation, or various aspects of the economy such as finance and production, these remarkable achievements of humanity owe their existence to microchips, which serve as their brains. The significance of microchip production cannot be understated, as our modern society would be fundamentally different without them. This is why major powers like the United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China prioritize the production of microchips. It not only supports their defense sectors but also boosts domestic production and consumption, thereby strengthening the overall economy. Among the numerous companies involved in manufacturing this precious resource of the 21st century, our focus in this paper is on Intel Corporation.

# Purpose

The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the progress of Intel Corporation (INTC) over the previous five years, spanning from 2018 to 2022. It encompasses more than just the financial statements, encompassing a comprehensive assessment that includes a comparison to its primary rival, Advanced Micro Device (AMD), as well as an analysis of the market conditions. These efforts aim to ascertain the equitable valuation of the stock price and devise an investment strategy.

# Methodology

Within this paper, the financial data utilized is sourced from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance, and other publicly accessible information pertaining to the company online. The valuation of the company is derived by considering the following methods:

* Discounted Free Cash Flow
* Graham's Fair Value
* Graham's Number

# Industry Outlook

**Overview**

The global chip industry faces a challenging scenario where shortages and oversupply coincide, presenting a significant concern. As we enter 2023, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are emerging as the dominant forces shaping the semiconductor sector. Various factors have contributed in a substantial decline in the sector’s market capitalization. Factors such as: Rising interest rates; High inflation; Diminished consumer confidence; Stock market retreats led by the technology sector; The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies dropped by 34% from US$2.9 trillion in November 2021 to US$1.9 trillion in November 202 The Philadelphia Semiconductor index experienced a decline of 45% since January and closed the year down by 37% in October 2022. While high-end memory prices dropped by 50% over the past year, the supply chain for phones, personal computers, and data centers has largely normalized in terms of lead times. However, the industry as a whole still faces elevated lead times of around 25.5 weeks, compared to the usual 10-14 weeks as of October 2022.

Moreover, there is still a severe shortage of certain types of chips, particularly power management and microcontrollers that are crucial for industries such as automotive. Adding to these challenges, the conflict in Ukraine has disrupted supply chains, access to vital raw materials, and energy prices worldwide, particularly in Europe. These disruptions are expected to persist throughout 2023. Additionally, the US government's measures in October 2022 to tighten regulations on the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to China are likely to have a significant impact on the entire industry and its downstream customers in 2023. In response to increased capital costs, inventory drawdowns, and declining earnings, many chip companies are implementing cost-cutting measures, reducing employee headcounts, and postponing capital expenditures for additional capacity. It should be noted that while capital expenditure spending in 2023 is expected to surpass that of 2020, it will be lower than previously anticipated.

Despite the challenges, there may be opportunities for the industry to shift its focus beyond merely catching up during a shortage. 2023 could serve as a moment to pause and allow the semiconductor industry to consider five significant aspects:

* Bringing manufacturing closer to home through the establishment of new fabs and the expansion of existing facilities, emphasizing the use of friendshoring, where countries and regions recognize the need for trusted allies in their semiconductor supply chain.
* Managing the risks and challenges associated with localization and friendshoring. Implementing digital transformation and digitization across various processes, including financial planning and operations, order management, and supply chain management.
* Addressing and balancing the talent equation in the semiconductor industry, which includes shortages in certain roles and layoffs in others.
* Establishing and accelerating progress towards achieving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, with a particular focus on sustainability.

In both the United States and Europe, there is a growing emphasis on enhancing domestic industrial capacity in the chipmaking sector while acknowledging that complete self-sufficiency may not be feasible. As highlighted by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in introducing the EU Chips Act, no country or continent can be entirely self-sufficient.

It's important to note that "chips" encompass various categories, such as memory, logic, mixed signal, and power semiconductors, each serving different end markets (e.g., smartphones, PCs, and automotive). These chips require different wafer sizes, process technologies, materials, facilities, equipment, design tools, radiation tolerance, and more.

The semiconductor industry operates under two primary models: the fabless/foundry/OSAT ecosystem and the integrated device manufacturing model (IDM), which combines all three roles. Manufacturing processes are diverse, relying on multiple semiconductor materials, specialized epoxies, and a wide range of fabrication, testing, and assembly equipment. Some critical components may have only one manufacturer or source, while the concentration of facilities can increase risks associated with natural disasters, conflicts, power shortages, or other disruptions.

# Main Competitors

Intel, being the sole cutting-edge semiconductor firm in the United States engaged in both technology development and manufacturing, exerts a far-reaching influence on all sectors of the national economy and enjoys a strategic edge over its rivals. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the largest publicly traded semiconductor chip manufacturer in the US. Intel's noteworthy contribution lies in the invention of the x86 microprocessor, an integral component found in nearly all modern personal computers. Despite its dominant position, Intel operates within a highly competitive landscape, contending with numerous players vying for market dominance. Presented below are a few of Intel's primary contenders in the industry:

* **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** AMD is a major competitor to Intel in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the market for x86 microprocessors. AMD has gained market share in recent years with its Ryzen processors, offering strong competition to Intel's offerings.
* **NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA):** While primarily known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), NVIDIA has expanded into other areas, including data center processors and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Intel and NVIDIA compete in the data center and AI markets, where both companies strive to provide high-performance computing solutions.
* **Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM):** Qualcomm is a leading semiconductor company specializing in wireless technologies, particularly in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Intel and Qualcomm compete in areas such as mobile processors and wireless connectivity solutions.
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC):** TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and manufactures chips for various companies, including Intel's competitors. As a foundry, TSMC competes indirectly with Intel by providing manufacturing services to companies developing their own chip designs.
* **Samsung Electronics (005930)**: Samsung is a major player in the semiconductor industry, manufacturing a wide range of chips, including memory chips, application processors, and image sensors. Samsung competes with Intel in various segments, such as memory chips and mobile processors.

These are just a few examples of Intel's main competitors in the semiconductor industry. The market is highly dynamic, with new players and emerging technologies constantly shaping the competitive landscape. In this paper, AMD will be the main benchmark value used to evaluate INTC.

# Fair Value

Taking in Mind the projected forecast of the previous section, it is derived the Fair Value of a single piece of the Company's stock with three different methodologies: Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity; Graham's Fair Value Graham Number.

**Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity**

Plugging in the number and the assumptions, it is concluded that Intel Corporation is worth, at its current conditions, operations, assents, market share and potential cash flow at least 148 Billions US dollars. While its Fair Market Capitalisation shall be at least 134 Billions US dollars, which meat a Fair Value per share around the 32 USD price tag. Considering an error of 10%, its fair value fluctuates between $29 and $36

**Graham's Fair Value**

The Fair Value model, with a multiplier of 1, EPS of 1.9 and P/E of 15.4, we can calculate Intel's ideal price tag, which is $58.45.

**Graham's Number**

By using the Father of Value Investing's formula, with a multiplier of 22.5, we can extract a Fair Value of 32.51 Dollars, which is really close to the price tag we got with the DCFE model with realised before.

# Conclusions

**Disclaimer**

We shall analyse and forecast our predictions by keeping always in mind that the future is always mutable and nothing shall be taken for granted. The market sentiment, the overall status of the economy or black swans events can disrupt every analysts predictions. By knowing this, it is advisable to review ones investing strategy and goals periodically in order to top up the most recent data into the models and be always prepared for outliers. This paper is not financial advice and shall be used to support one own due diligence and research.

**The Future**

Intel Corporation has undergone a transformation to regain its engineering edge and focus on software and hardware engineering. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company aims to reclaim its manufacturing leadership and become a chipmaker for the world. Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy involves becoming a "systems foundry" and partnering with TSMC and Samsung for chip design and connectivity interfaces. The company is investing in new factories and acquiring Tower Semiconductor to expand its chip offerings. However, Intel faces challenges such as managing costs, navigating geopolitical shifts, and complying with regulations. The company is advancing chip scaling, performance, packaging, and software solutions. Intel is also open to partnerships with smaller chipmakers to drive business to its factories. External customers will have access to Intel's advanced processes, including Intel 18A in the coming years.

**Conclusions**

INTC is going under heavy scrutiny by investors and customers due to their stagnation and lack of innovation. The Gigant that dominated the market probably is falling, we cannot be sure, but it is certain that the management will try to turn things around. With still big revenues, huge cash positions and assets, and expecially with the US Government favours, they are far from dying. The company, compare to its main Rival, it is still a powerful company capable to moving markets and generating wealth. We are certain that this little competition will awake the sleeping company.

The countries focused on in this article were Zambia and Sri Lanka. As someone who is beginning their journey to understanding financial markets and the global strings pulling at them, I'm asking everyone here what would happen if a country just decided to ignore their debt to another nation? I am aware that it would massively impact the worlds trust with them and could potentially limit future loans, but why does it impact the country initially? (The article said that they lost 50% of manufacturing jobs and inflation went rampant.) What happens if the country just says, "Na, I'm not acknowledging that debt anymore"? Short of all out war, how would they even enforce a debt in that case? Is it even possible without imposing sanctions and further destabilizing the global market?

While I understand this may not be the ideal location to gain understanding, there is no way to isolate what happens to countries in the geopolitical sphere from the markets. Understanding one can help make predictions in the other, so any insight?Russia obviously cannot win the war, and although Ukraine has some problems to deal with, either a Ukrainian victory or at least a settlement of the conflict is becoming more and more likely. What do you think about Ukrainian agricultural stocks, which were doing well before 2022 and have lost a lot of value because of the war. Probably after the war, a lot will be invested in the reconstruction of the country. Do you think that now is the right time to buy the dip of stocks like MHP SE, IMC S.A. or Kernel Holding S.A.?# Powell's Pause, Yellen's Warning: A Double Whammy for the Market?

**May 19th Recap**

Market participants scaled back their expectations for a June rate increase by the Federal Reserve to a mere 25%, following indications from Jerome Powell of a potential hiatus. The equity markets experienced a downturn, primarily driven by a slump in banking shares and mounting anxiety over the inability of US legislators to establish a consensus to avert a default.

The S&P 500 halted its two-day streak of gains, unable to sustain above the critical threshold of 4,200, following comments from a Republican representative suggesting a temporary halt in bipartisan discussions in Washington. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy remained silent when questioned about upcoming debt-ceiling discussions.

Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P Regional Banking exchange-traded fund, valued at $3.2 billion, saw a near 2% decline. This drop came in response to news that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had informed leaders of prominent financial institutions that further consolidations might be necessary.

# Economic Thunderstorm Brewing: Unpacking the Vital Data Releases of May 23-26

The coming week of May 23 to May 26, 2023, holds several economic data releases that can potentially impact the market. On Tuesday, May 23, preliminary readings for the S&P Global Composite, Manufacturing, and Services PMI for May will be released, with the consensus for all three at 50, 50, and 53.6, respectively, indicating a stable outlook. New Home Sales data for April is also anticipated, with a consensus estimate of 0.663 million, slightly lower than the previous month's figure.

On Wednesday, May 24, the market will closely watch the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, which provide insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.

A series of significant data will be released on Thursday, May 25, including preliminary data for the Q1 Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (expecting a 4.9% increase), Gross Domestic Product (forecasted at 1.1% annualized growth), and the GDP Price Index (forecasted at 4%). Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending May 19 are also expected, with a consensus estimate of 253,000, slightly above the previous week's number. Pending Home Sales data for April will be released, expecting a small rise of 0.2% after a significant drop in the previous month.

Finally, on Friday, May 26, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures - Price Index for April is due, with MoM and YoY consensus estimates at 0.4% and 5%, respectively. Durable Goods Orders for April are also expected, with the market preparing for a decrease. Personal Income and Spending data for April, both estimated to rise by 0.4%, will be released as well. The week will end with the release of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for May, a significant indicator of consumer confidence.

# SPY Technical Outlook

The technical outlook for SPY suggests a bullish bias overall. Important levels and targets have been identified for both upward and downward movements. The analysis indicates an anticipation of a minor or major pullback, with specific levels highlighted on the daily and 1-hour charts. On the 15-minute chart, a bearish bias is observed, accompanied by hidden divergence on the RSI, which indicates underlying weakness during retracements in a downtrend. Looking ahead to Monday, there is an expectation of a potential rejection at either the resistance line or the 419 level, creating a favorable opportunity to enter the market short towards the Bullish Order Block.

On the 15 minute RSI, we have a hidden divergence playing out. This indicates underlying weakness and is found during retracements in a downtrend. Nice to see during price retests of previous highs.

Based on this information, I believe we will see a rejection at either the resistance line or the 419 (bullish shift) level on Monday and will give us a good opportunity to enter the market short to the Bullish Order Block.

- Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager, is moving out of US assets in favor of China.
- The move is motivated by China's brighter economic prospects, better valuations, and a more benign outlook for inflation.
- Vincent Mortier, chief investment officer of Amundi, believes that too much risk is priced into Chinese credit and high-quality companies, while markets in the US are "too optimistic" as a recession looms.
- Mortier predicts that the US economy will not grow next year, while China, India, and Indonesia will each grow by 5 to 6 percent.
- Despite recent political tensions and disappointing economic data, Amundi is optimistic about China and has been gradually increasing its allocation to China and India over the past 12 months.
- Mortier is particularly keen on opportunities in select Chinese corporate bonds, arguing that foreign investors have been blanket selling without differentiating between the quality of issuers.
- US markets are pricing in a "goldilocks" scenario of low inflation, rate cuts, stronger earnings, and a soft landing, which Mortier thinks is becoming increasingly remote as financial conditions tighten.
- Mortier thinks inflation in both the US and Europe will stabilize at around 3 to 4 percent in the years ahead, with some volatility that will make the Fed's job particularly difficult.
- However, Mortier is not worried about the possibility of a US debt default.I took some pretty poor advice from a close family member that I thought was savvy and considering their experience in finance, had a great find to start a cannabis portfolio in 2018

While the money currently in unrealized losses isn't life changing, at the time I definitely could have gone safer with reasonable ETF's, Index Funds, or even some dividend yielding blue chips. Alas I too am just an ape and decided not to sell until the post October rug was pulled out after Canada legalized.

Despite these companies having brutal debt positions, and the malaise and oversaturation of the Canadian weed market, should I bother holding on one day for a buy-out or bounce back? Even if I break even, inflation would kill any worth in "breaking even" after 5 years of sinking into worthless value. Mind you this is in Canadian Pesos.

Should I just sell, and take the loss for future tax benefits on sales of actual gains? This particular portfolio was meant to be an experiment and not all I had.

Tl;dr should I hold hoping it breaks even, or sell and take the tax break later on when I sell other stuff.I am going in with a bunch of baggy puts 30 320 QQQ (You can guess when I bought these LOL), 10 330 QQQ puts, and 20 410 SPY puts and 10 SPY call 5/26 425. I'm thinking markets will be volatile and hope that my puts will eventually print... But, most likely calls will do better. All spy positions are 26 and QQQ's are on 23rd.

For NVDA I was planning to open a call position closer to the day of earnings, because I suspect markets to be swinging back and forth. But, now I'm conflicted, cause I was just bored and looking at some news on CNBC for fun. And came upon this... So yea now Idk I actually kind of agree with Cramer and I know I should inverse myself/Cramer, but this AI hype train is just too FOMO/YOLO/STRONK energy .

Powell: High inflation poses significant hardship; Fed strongly committed to returning to 2% goal; possible there will be continued supply shocks but hard to predict; **rates may not need to rise as high given credit stress**; recently it has been the case that markets are pricing a different rate path; so far data seemed to support the committee's view that it will take time to lower inflation; we can afford to look at data and ongoing outlook.

Liquidity update: The liquidity proxy, which is calculated as the Fed's total assets minus the Treasury General Account (TGA) and reverse repurchase agreements (RRP), is expected to be affected once a debt ceiling deal is reached. If the TGA is funded through a direct offering, we may initially observe a drop in liquidity. However, as the government begins to spend its funds, liquidity is expected to increase again. On the other hand, if the TGA utilizes RRP funds, we will likely see an overall increase in liquidity.

Bank deposit outflow continues. But it poses a greater challenge for small banks compared to large banks. I said it before, and I will say it again. Large banks don’t need or want your money. If you haven’t heard, loan demand is at a decade low. Deposits are simply liabilities for them. Small banks also don’t need your money but can’t afford to lose deposits, because it might trigger a bank run.

 If large banks want your money, their rates will be a lot higher, the same as what you see in small banks today.

On the other hand, lending activity has remained relatively stable. While loans at large banks experienced a slight decline, small banks actually saw a small increase, albeit modest.

Happy Friday. My positions have not changed since yesterday.Well a lot of people like to think that the market doesn’t care about rate hikes and that the market has stopped caring about what JPOW has to say… today would prove that is absolutely incorrect…

Now this wasn’t quite Jackson hole 2.0 this was just as exciting. Overall the most interesting thing to me is that I didn’t see anywhere that JPOW said we were going to pause in June at FOMC… However, the Market actually went from a 64.4% odds of a pause at open to now an 81.5% odds we pause at the June FOMC.

Looking at next week really we do have some data to keep in mind and of course more fed speakers… most notable is that there is nothing on Monday. PMI Tuesday, Wednesday FOMC minutes will be the big one to keep an eye on… I actually have a strong suspicion that we will run Monday Tuesday then make Wednesday our top…. Prelim GDP Thursday and then Friday is PCE, personal income and then lastly UMICH inflation. 

Not amazing data that I think sends us 1% +/- pre market but definitely stuff to keep an eye on. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

I have great news for you guys! I spent a very long time doing some back testing (unfortunately its all manual). While I am no longer granted access to the other supply and demand indicator I have found high success and correlation with this new indicator I am using. I will not be sharing exactly how I derive these levels but they are very promising and I have been using it the last two days intraday day trading and I have had some amazing success. 

I look forward to these levels on a daily and weekly timeframe now and hope you guys enjoy them too. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t1pwwlxnpu0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=db520b76907a562809728cdb743c592535ae861e

From a supply and demand stand point here after we put in 410.2 demand (support) we have not looked back at all… we have flown through a ton of supplies from 413.05 to 419.5… 419.5 was a major level that I was keeping an eye on and is a major pivot point. Now we did break over it and reject. However, note that this daily candle is NOT a double top. 

Also note that after 419.5 there is no resistance or levels until 429.68. 

The way I am reading this is that our target really should be 429.68. However, a few things we need to note… the weekly on SPY is about to enter extreme bull momentum. The DMI is almost extreme overbought also. There are a few other things I am watching too and most of those besides one is bullish. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/br8eydeopu0b1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8d6dcc91d078f1037b66e1a6c910f253edc5afa4

Now when I look at the weekly I think its very important to note that not only did we close over 416.08 weekly supply (resistance) but we also established a new demand (support) at 411.46 this week. We essentially retested and bounced off the now support of the range for the last almost 2 months and now we are on a push up.

The next major upside target is 427.35 supply from August. After that I don’t have much until 453.23 (now I don’t expect that to happen just noting). 

From a technical standpoint with us putting in a fresh demand (support) we should continue to expect upside until a new weekly supply (resistance) is put in. We also had a very nice bounce off the weekly 8ema. Now the difference from daily to weekly is that the DMI is not overbought at all and actually is in the process of waving up which means this bullishness on a weekly timeframe has a good amount left to go…

We remain in the black rising wedge on the daily and also have a smaller timeframe rising red wedge too. Now we were not able to close over 419.5 which in my opinion is a major pivot point. However this candle is not a true rejection and downside candle in my opinion either. 

The most probable case is either a drop back to 416 to 416.8 to retest support and the daily 8ema before we push higher or there is a case where we see a pretty strong Monday and Tuesday run and then the markets negatively react to FOMC minutes and that becomes our temporary top.

Now as I mentioned 427.35 was a weekly supply and target I had. IF you look at the weekly PA here we have a major resistance and pivot point there also from the August top. This in my opinion is 100% the next major resistance and the next major bull target to watch. 

Now that the bulls have officially broken out of this range we had been in for almost 2 weeks and have a nice weekly 8ema support bounce I will be looking for that continued upside. 

I honestly get told I am a permabear a lot.. but I really do play both sides… its just that from a macro/ economic/ just reality stand point we in no way shape or form should be looking at the 430s… honestly from a value standpoint I would say that 390s would be a fair price target right now. 

SPY Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 416.1 -> 427.4  
 Demand- 411.5   
 Support- 412.1 -> 407.7 -> 404  
 Resistance- 418.6 -> 422 -> 427.6

On futures daily S/D is the same story here… however, the difference is that we did put in that 4127 demand (support) and pushed through quite a few supplies…

We did leave 4040-4055 supplies down low and now have a bigger sell off magnet to 4150-4154 also. However, the futures daily is a double top right now. The thing I am watching for to happen is that we immediately turn around and go from double top to double bottom off 4200. In doing so we should start to seek out upside still.

There is a chance that we could sell off Monday to establish 4216 as a new supply (resistance). In doing so we would take out 4190/4197 supplies. We would target a bounce off the daily 8ema near 4170-4180 for a support bounce. That would most probably establish a new demand which would give us the technical support to continue to push higher.

From the weekly here we did much like SPY establish a new weekly demand (support) at 4130 which is the bottom of our range that we have been in for the last 8 weeks now. Not only that but we are also going to completely bullishly engulf this last 2 months of trading with this closure over the 4193 supply. 

Right now my weekly target on Futes would be 4284.

From a price action stand point I mentioned that I would be curious if the daily could come back down to retest 4191 or not… We have officially at this point turned previous major resistance into now support. I would like to see one more closure over it and potentially even another bounce off it to feel 100% confident that it is support but this chart looks very bullish for me. 

One note is that we still have not gotten through that 4240 resistance area from February highs.

The first thing to talk about is that this was officially the 7th week post JPM collar roll… I have mentioned a few times that there is a historical trend of reversing the direction of the 7 weeks post leading into week 11. However, there is a few times where we have seen the trend actually explode even more. 

It is possible that we could see another 4 weeks of running before we find a top… one other thing to mention is that the JPM collar calls are at 4300 and we have often touched that level before rejecting. 

This weekly double bottom/ bullish engulfing candle in my opinion is very bullish and very strong for the bulls next week. However, we are now coming into some pretty strong resistance dating back to August. 4280 is the PA top from August which is right near that 4284 supply that I am targeting also. 

Futures Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 4293 -> 4284  
 Demand- 4130 -> 3920  
 Support- 4130 -> 4095

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

It has been long requested that I include QQQ and I don’t usually like to include anything more then I am already looking at but I do wanna start keeping a closer eye on Tech. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1jantgsrpu0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=436f6ca47c29cc19a360fca12f9de9fb332150fb

Now the QQQ daily is due for a pullback and I actually full expect to see that Monday. We today established a new supply at 337.29 and at the same time to the penny rejected my the demand level that has been level on the charts since March of 2022. So now that this demand level is finally taken out the question is what is next? 

From an S/D stand point once a new supply is established we look for a retrace to previous supply or the EMA (especially since we are in extreme bull momentum). For QQQ I see a pullback to 333.11 and if it wants to hold this yellow rising wedge it can drop no lower than 332 on Tuesday. 

The daily 8ema is likely going to become a hard bounce and establish a new demand and even possible turn 333 supply into a demand. In doing so my upside target would be 347.11 supply and potentially on a huge blow off top 351.57 demand. 

**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/13gz1v9spu0b1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e69a4707f2664e96e54fe9772a5975ea4a1688d

I find myself on QQQ weekly S/D feeling the same way I do about SPY weekly that a bigger upside move is coming. This week QQQ actually established a new demand (Support) at 322.47. In doing so it pushed hard through 330.67 supply. We now have about a $31 lull in levels where this is no clear resistance. 

However from a weekly stand point DMI is still waving up (bullish) and we are still in extreme bull momentum with some other technical also supporting a bigger move up or atleast bullishness.

I would NOT be short QQQ until we see a new supply put in and even then I would only be short till we see the weekly 8ema. 

**VIX**

Looking at the F/G index you can see we are nearing the same level of FG that we did almost a month ago when we were actually lower then current levels. IT would appear that the FG wants to push back into extreme greed. AT that time is when I would start to consider 60-90dte puts. My guess is that will be around the time FOMC happens.

Now one interesting thing about the VIX which also supports the bullishness on SPY/QQQ is the fact that we are in weekly extreme bear momentum on VIX. This means the downside should continue to be expected. 

We did come down however and have a really nice inside candle body on VIX. We also attempted to get back over that critical 16.92 VIX level, however, we hard rejected the daily 8/20ema and closed in the 16s again. 

I actually in all honestly would not be surprised to see the VIXs in the 14s in the next week or two. 

**DXY/ 10YR YIELD**

Now one thing I said I was very confused on is the fact that DXY and the 10YR rallied with SPY/QQQ. We should have seen the opposite affect. DXY did break its support line from this breakout…. A bigger sell off in the DXY back to the 101-102 area could be the final push up on spy/ tech. I am also seeing the 10YR come into decent resistance here and would be surprised to see some weakness start to show up in the 10YR.

I had a great day and an even better week trading. I actually during that JPOW speech hit a nice 50% gainer which I honestly cant remember the last time ive had a win that big. I unfortunately missed on my first put about 100% gainer but in the end profits are profits and you never know how those events are gonna go.

I actually put in again my most profitable week of 2023 and my most profitable week since December of 2022. 

From a day trading stand point (as in not including swings or lottos) this is my most profitable week of strictly day trading since October 2022. 

I continue to find my confidence but also most importantly my patience in this market. I had a really big problem before of either not trusting myself or chasing plays too much. I have found myself now that I am okay missing a play as I know there will always be another play. I have also never felt so confident and trusting in my strategy that has proven itself to be worthy of the trust. 

I look forward to another great week of trading next week!- zoom is a trash ass company, until now

- they talking AI. During earnings they gonna talk AI so hard it’s gonna make u puke

- everyone working at home. SF office real estate selling for -75%. Vacancies are 20-30% nation wide

- other countries using zoom like crazy

- zoom the shit

- zoom about to go up 32% on earnings Monday I ain’t playin

- I heard from word on the street that rich the kid is buying too. Along with some other funds

- $ZM $83c 5/26/23

- I heard there’s even zoom porn but idkI think bank stocks, for the most part, are beat up and there is almost certainly opportunity in there somewhere. 

Any thoughts on particular strategies or particular banks people are looking at? My personal opinion is that the pure psychological bank run threat is likely over (at least for now unless there's another catalyst), and, instead, banks are being priced at the risk from Commercial Real Estate (which could be the catalyst for bank runs in the future) 

Some thoughts I've ever seen on reddit or looked into myself are:

&#x200B;

**-PACWP (PacWest preferred shares):** saw somebody else on here post this play. It's effectively buy the preferred shares, which have a 20% dividend yield as PACW is being priced like it might fail, and not only do you get a high dividend yield but there's at least some protection above common shares in the event that it gets liquidated as preferred shares are higher priority and liquidity value of the shares is $25 while PACWP is currently trading at about $10 a share. 

&#x200B;

\-**WAL (Western Alliance Bank)**: When rumors came about PACW was looking for a buyer rumors about WAL came out also. Since then WAL has denied them but, with its share price beat up, can be upside if they are not next on the chopping block.

&#x200B;

\-**KRE (Regional banks ETF)**: Beat up but is diversified across a number of banks so, presumably, risk is diversified as well. 

&#x200B;

\-**DPST (3x Bull Regional banks ETF)**: 3x leveraged KRE. Theoretical 3x high side. Looked at this for a bit but don't recommend as it erodes away over time and, overall, realized that the downside risk is much higher than the upside. 

&#x200B;

\-**USB (US Bancorp)**: Currently looking at this one. Is beat up but is a much larger bank. Is large enough that deposits increased as customers pulled there money from smaller banks and put them into USB. Dividend yield is about 6% right now. Seems like solid long-term play with good upside of potentially doubling your money. 

&#x200B;

Any thoughts on this appreciated. Particularly, if anybody has looked at USB and has thoughts on it.Check out this week's [Earnings Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13m2tfd/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/) and [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/contentguide). DM the [mod inbox/sex line](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets)I purchased some TSLL a few weeks ago. I'm up but I'm not sure if I should stick with the leveraged fund or just sell and buy some more TSLA. 

Has anyone in the group had any experience with TSLL or a similar fund?

I've looked into it and it's odd that it has the 1.5 multiplier but only 27% of the holdings are TSLA stock. What are the other holdings? Are they options that are owned by banks?

I think this is a really cool concept that allows options play without options risk. Any insight would be appreciated.

Thanks everyone! IT sector’s discretionary nature and high debt levels make it vulnerable to interest rate hikes. Additionally, the valuation of tech companies, which dominate the information services sector, relies heavily on future profit expectations. With rising interest rates, borrowing costs and debt servicing become more challenging, often leading to reduced spending, hiring freezes, and ultimately, layoffs.Do whatever you feel necessary. I'm simply here to inform.

1) The q's have hit 2 standard deviations from the weekly expected move and have hit RSI levels of 70+ with all mega-cap tech stocks in the overbought territory. We also saw a strong near 2% move the other day likely because people were shorting on the 50% fib and were forced to cover (aka squeezed).

7)  We're seeing conditions that favor a rotation in the markets. Megacap tech is getting overvalued whereas other parts of the market is becomming more fair value. My personal thoughts is that the gains on these stocks are being frontloaded in the first 2 quarters and likely the back half where everyone keeps saying earnings will be better will likely have a rotation. Earlier this year, they were saying the first half would be bad and of course the inverse happened.

But did you know that you can profit from it? My grandfather always told me “invest in things that people have no choice but to buy” and clean air and water is certainly such a necessity. Pollution remediation is big bucks, and its about to get even more costly and companies like **Chart Industries (GLTS), Ecolabs (ECL) and Kuraway** stand to profit immensely from it. The US Environmental Protection Agency, (the “EPA”) regulates clean air and clean water and has proposed major changes in both PFAS regulation and natural gas plant carbon emission standards. If same regulations go into effect, it will result in virtually every water company in America having to purchase PFAS remediation systems. [Likewise, nearly 32% of American electricity is currently produced using natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/use-of-natural-gas.php) resulting in a large number of companies needed to purchase carbon capture technology systems to achieve compliance. This post will largely focus on the new PFAS water regulations.

**PFAS**

[The soonest anticipated change is a new EPA regulation that will limit PFAS in America’s potable water supply to 4 parts per trillion, with the public comment period scheduled to end on May 30th for the proposed rule.](https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas) It is widely expected that the new rule will pass. The term PFAS stands for per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances. These chemicals are used as flame retardants, fire-fighting foams and as non-stick agents. They were frequently used in the past to manufacture of fire retardant furniture, non-stick pans and fire fighting foams. As a result they are spread literally everywhere in minute amounts throughout the country. [They are literally everywhere, even in the rain](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-62391069). They also don’t easily breakdown in the environment and thus have been referred to as a “forever chemical”.

&#x200B;

[PFAS EVERYWHERE](https://preview.redd.it/xsqjy2vpjt0b1.jpg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5bda6bfc792950d86d0b3f7da161796885e0b545)

[So why all the concern about PFAS? Well, it has been alleged that they can cause kidney cancer, testicular cancer and thyroid diseas](https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/what-we-study/pfas)e even in very small amounts. However, there is currently no federal regulation at all about PFAS levels in drinking water. S[everal states have stepped in and have set forth their own regulations, these range anywhere from 5.1 parts per trillion in California to 140,000 parts per trillion for a specific PFAS chemical in Michigan.](https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/events-insights-news/state-by-state-regulation-of-pfas-substances-in-drinking-water.html)The EPA is proposing a federal limit of 4 parts per trillion to be enacted across the country.  This is an extremely huge change. To comply with any PFAS limitation by reducing contamination, a water company is required to purchase and install purifying systems to literally remove the PFAS from the water. These various technologies have different levels of effectiveness. Thus a water company in Connecticut that has already installed treatment systems to comply with that states 70 parts per trillion limitation may now be required to install a new more efficient system to comply with the new 4 parts per trillion federal regulation! The result is that nearly every water company in America will be forced to go out and buy PFAS treatment equipment all at the same time. Thus demand will skyrocket, while the supply of systems will remain largely unchanged over a short period of time. I[t is estimated that to comply with the new regulations would cost water companies $3.8 billion annually, with large start up costs.](https://phys.org/news/2023-03-pfas-1.html) The installation of treatment systems will result in recurring annual costs, because as water is treated the PFAS treatment systems themselves use up substances that must be replaced once they are depleted. There are two primary means currently used for the removal of PFAS from water. The first is granular activated charcoal. This is stored in a massive huge vessel with alternating layers of activated charcoal and other substances to literally scrub the PFAS out of the water. Eventually the activated charcoal becomes so loaded with PFAS (and other pollutants) that it must be replaced.

&#x200B;

[A Calgon brand Granulated Activated Charcoal type PFAS filter, note its immense size](https://preview.redd.it/phiafc8rjt0b1.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8a060aae515d09613aa16321b5a37e1e6950627d)

The second primary means of removing PFAS from water is through an Ion exchange resin treatment system. This type of system uses a chemical that attracts and sucks PFAS out of the water and binds it to a resin. Like with the granulated activated charcoal, as water is treated the resin is used up and must be regularly replaced as water is treated. While the ion-exchange resin technology is more efficient, it also is more expensive than the granulated activated charcoal.

Given that public outcry regarding PFAS contamination has been growing for the past several years,  private equity firms and conglomerates have been buying up companies that produce PFAS treatment systems. [For example, one of the largest granulated activated charcoal producers in America is Calgon Carbon, which was purchased by the Japanese corporation, Kuraray in 2018.](https://www.calgoncarbon.com/media/press-releases/2018-09-03/6927/) Norit, another huge activated [carbon producer was acquired by One Equity Partners, a private equity firm, in 2022](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220302006084/en/One-Equity-Partners-Completes-Acquisition-of-Norit-Activated-Carbon/). If you have access to the Japanese market, Kuraway is publicly traded, but its ADRs barely trade here in the USA. So that begs to ask, Scipio, I’m not a private equity bro, how can I, the everyday trader invest in PFAS remediation. There are two companies that I have identified that present such an opportunity.

**Chart Industries (GTLS) – INVERSE CRAMER!**

Just like the private equity firms I have mentioned, Chart Industries has jumped into the PFAS remediation game by acquiring AdEdge Water Technologies, a water treatment company. [This is something that Cramer completely overlooked when he recently shat on the company in a post in Januar](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/05/cramers-lightning-round-chart-industries-is-not-a-buy.html)y. AdEdge builds both granulated activated charcoal and ion-exchange resin type PFAS filtration systems. T[hey also signed a business referral deal with Calgon Carbon where anyone who contacts Calgon to purchase PFAS remediation systems of a certain size is immediately referred to Chart Industries AdEdge business.](https://www.calgoncarbon.com/media/press-releases/2022-09-06/chartwater-and-calgon-carbon-announce-referral-agreement/)This will ensure a steady flow of business to Chart for new PFAS clients. As an added bonus, Chart also builds carbon capture systems for gas fed power plants. Therefore, if the EPA’s newly proposed gas fed power plant carbon emissions standards come into being, Chart will profit off that as well. [Finally, a big selling point for Chart is that their stock price is still heavily depressed from an overreaction related to their purchase of Howden, a gas and air handling products producer.](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/03/17/2629484/9318/en/Chart-Industries-Completes-the-Acquisition-of-Howden.html) However, despite the purchase and related negative EPS, Chart still showed earnings results that beat estimates in its most recent quarter.

Ecolab (ECL) – Bill Gates clean water baby

[As this autist pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13ewahu/it_takes_tinfoil_to_make_tendies_part_1_ecl), another major player in the clean water technology field is Bill Gates backed Ecolabs. However, what he missed was that Ecolabs stands to profit immensely from the new federal [PFAS regulations as in 2021 it paid $3.7 billion to purchase Purelite.](https://www.ecolab.com/news/2021/10/ecolab-to-acquire-purolite-to-life-sciences-critical-industrial-markets) Purelite is[one of the largest ion-exchange resin manufactures in the world.](https://www.purolite.com/index) As stated previously, any ion-exchange resin type treatment system uses up the resin as the water is treated. Thus, a steady stream of resin sales will continue indefinitely once the new Federal regulations come into effect.

Nokia as a AI  play!!  Get in now...
Man watching youtubers more than a year ago playing around with FSD gave me bad impressions of the service. It was clunky, dangerous at times and involved constant interventions and or takeovers.

It felt too gimmicky and required too much baby sitting to be practical, infact you felt more stressed  using FSD than regular driving.

It honestly looked like it was more than 5 years away from usability.


I've been watching some videos recently on tesla FSD just to see where they were at...

My mind is blown, the improvement is incredible. So much smoother and barely any interventions. Not saying it's ready for robotaxi, but maybe it is.

Question is, even if it was ready, how long would it take for tesla to get approval to run a robotaxi from regulators if they applied for it this year???

Economy is shit right now So I don't think teslas gonna have the chatgpt moment where everyone just subscribes.The Walt Disney Company has scrapped a plan to invest nearly $1bn (£806m) to build a new corporate campus in Florida, it announced.
The reversal comes amid an escalating feud between the entertainment giant and the state's Republican-led government headed by Ron DeSantis.-NKE has Historically bounced off of 50day and 200day MA seen as support levels since its inception as a company.

-Yesterday was the beginning of the bounce-back/volume surge.

-Foot locker tanked the shoe industry today. But foot locker and nike are two completely different companies. 
Foot locker is a dying retail shoe store.(the value of these two different companies is EXTREMELY DIFFERENT)
Nike is an international sportswear conglomerate which has extreme fashion appeal(especially to our younger generations-looking at you air jordans) and has been succesfully switching to Direct-to-consumer model with its Nike, Sneakers app, and uptick of spending on marketing. 

-Reactions in the stock market are mostly over-reactions

-Nike has beat expectations consistently during some of the worst economic conditions weve seen in a very long time.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset (HV) and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-19.
* **Call/Put Pricing:** How much extra you are paying for IV relative to HV. Low numbers mean "cheaper." High numbers mean "expensive." A 1 means "fairly" priced.
* **Efficiency:** This the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price and approximates the cost of a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
* **Direction:** This ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish). It accounts for RSI, trend, moving averages and put/call skew over the past 4 weeks.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have "weeklies", the underlying is "too cheap", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.
* **How should this be improved?** Do you have any suggestions or notice any bugs with this report?The story started in 2016 when **Wells Fargo created millions of unauthorized customer accounts** and imposed auto insurance on hundreds of thousands of clients.

Following that, in 2018, Federal Reserve issued several orders requiring to improve client practices and governance at Wells Fargo. For years the bank has been working under consent orders and reported to investors significant improvements over the past situation and did not mention any compliance issues.

Until Marth 2020, when governmental reports revealed the fact that **Wells Fargo is unable to stop harming its customers** and comply with the issued earlier orders. Right after the reports were published **stock plunged from 47$ to $30 causing investors billions in losses.**

And just now, **Wells Fargo decided to pay its shareholders $1 billion in compensation** while denying all the allegations. Attorneys will take up to 19% of that sum, everything else will go directly to the shareholders.

Any investor who has traded $WFC could be eligible for part of that money. **You can file for compensation** [**here**](https://11thestate.com/cases/wells-fargo-settlement)**.** (also you can prepare the documents yourself and send them to the settlement administrator's address)Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.**Come hang out with us on the NEW WallStreetBets[](https://twitter.com/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR) [Discord](https://discord.gg/wsbverse)!**

**However, as this graph demonstrates, if rates are not lowered by fall, the money supply will fall below the FED's 50 year steady trend line** (note that this graph is logarithmic -- the trend line is exponential). In the case it is not lowered at that time, ongoing inflation will go below desired levels which would cause additional economic damage that is undesirable to the FED's objectives.

**In the best case for the economy, rates will slowly go down beginning in the fall.** This will ease the economy into the normal money supply trend line which will also normalize inflation.

**In the worst case, the FED will delay lowering rates until early next year as CPI data (which is a trailing indicator) validates their inflation objectives.** However as the graph demonstrates, this will overshoot the money supply trend line and eventually cause inflation to go below FED objectives. After that inflation would be corrected again with extreme rate reductions and possibly QE which is undesirable.

**Right now is a real bull market. Smart money knows what I'm pointing out and is in full bull mode to beat the news.**Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's bullish. Think Amazon will miss the next earnings? That's bullish. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Bullish. You think insiders don't already know that? 

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in as bullish decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. 

Anything you can think of is bullish, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. Buy the dip. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe, you guessed it. Bullish). 

So please, before you bring up nuclear war, bread lines and civilizational collapse, don't ask such a dumb question again and understand that the prospect of 98% of us resorting to eating bone marrow from elon musk's discarded kitchen scraps is fucking bullish.
I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. 

I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.

I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.

## Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

## Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

## FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.76), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.82 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 62% and 73%. (Stats as of 2023-04-30)shorted puts on natty futures, got the hell out by 430p

Maybe a lesson to be learned here.. Bitcoin rode its way back up from 17 to 30k on the back of short liquidations. Liquidations forcing more liquidations like a domino effect. This happened at the peak of negative sentiment towards crypto.

Obviously crypto is more volatile and Nasdaq won't double in two weeks, but looking at short interests, it's still heavily shorted in many sectors. Particularly small/mid cap tech and growth stocks. With no catalysts to bail out the bear scenario, we can assume there won't be much reinforcement coming in to help shorts fight prices pushing up. And so focus will turn from large caps to oversold stocks which are mostly still heavily shorted. As the market gains momentum and confidence, it will look for any excuse to go after those short positions. Bulls have tasted blood and May may prove to be bear hunting season. Such a scenario is likely IMO and will easily push Nasdaq past October highs, and that in itself would act as a catalyst for a bigger rally.Its relatively cheap compared to NVDA valuation.

TSLA is turning into skynet from terminator.

I see TSLA going up atleast 40% from here. $300 min.

TSLA received alot of analyst downgrades after their recent quarter but after the shareholder meeting i think the stock will be re-evaluated. Institutional portfolio managers(big money) are waiting for buy ratings before they put in their orders. Its how the industry works.

&#x200B;Well it would appear for now the trend of two days of shorts covering and rallying is continuing. This momentum should come to an end tomorrow if the trend holds true… we will know for sure if that happens if we close a doji tomorrow.

We surprisingly have no data tomorrow morning However we will have two fed speakers (the last of the 14 that spoke this week I believe) and then the granddad of them all… JPOW himself will be speaking at 11am regarding “Due to participate in a panel discussion titled "Perspectives on Monetary Policy" at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, in Washington DC.” 

Now if you know JPOW he has a history of walking up to the mic and haven’t a lasting effect on the markets… we should absolutely expect some high volatility tomorrow. The most interesting thing to note that we will hear tomorrow is whether or not JPOW expects an additional rate hike in June. Any hint at another rate hike I would suspect that we see a pretty negative reaction. However, if he hints even briefly at a pause we likely could see a huge move up. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3stmlmuosn0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89002c555ff27f78f1725149164deb38ec9dfff8

What truly is intriguing to me is that leading up to Jackson hole in August we did see a rally much like the last two days. The day before Jackson Hole closed at 419.51 and today we closed extremely close at that 419.23 level. This is the highest the markets has been in about 9 months. 

As you can see we maintain this big rising wedge with the critical resistance and pivot point of 419.5. From here the way I see it is simple… tomorrow decides whether we start a move back to 405.3 or we start our next leg up and look for the 430s for the first time in 9 months. The rising wedge resistance sits at 422.07 for tomorrow. 

From here if we can close over 419.5 then the target would be 429.7 by end of next week. However, if this 419.5 becomes a nice double top or we get a nice doji reversal then I would start to think about that magnet 410-412 range. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Support- 416.8 -> 414.9 -> 412.3  
 Resistance- 422.1 -> 425.1

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

Now on futures this is where we have quite a bit of a difference in trend and levels… Jackson hole for Futes was at the 4283 level. However we closed at 4212 on futes which is where we have found support and resistance numerous times over the last year. 

As of right now the black rising wedge remains in tact and tomorrows resistance for that sits at 4265. We have not on futures at least taken out the resistance area of 4215 to 4237 yet. This could provide a nice top. However, the daily candle here would suggest further upside tomorrow. The next major area of resistance that we will be looking for is the august highs around 4310 to 4395. The 4300s will remain the next target if this bullish momentum can continue. 

A backtest and confirmation of 4191 support would confirm upside momentum. That 4191 level provided resistance for a long time and bulls being able to turn that into support would be a huge win in their books. 

Daily futures Levels  
 Support- 4191 -> 4171 -> 4152  
 Resistance- 4236 -> 4280 -> 4310

**VIX**

Now as impressively as bullish as everybody is out there… my one little bit of hesitation on truly being bullish is the fact that the VIX is coming not major support… as you can see 16.07 was major support and now that we have breached that the next target would be 15.78. 

The one question I would ask everyone is this… Going into a major event like JPOW speaking with the VIX only 3.3% away from its 52week low is the risk to the upside or to the downside? While its obviously not impossible for bulls to have another green day to end the week and to see the VIX see off to a new 52 week low… (a negative -6.7% drop on the VIX gets us into the 14s…) I would definitely say the risk is to the downside on SPY not the upside… It will be much harder for the bulls to continue this rally with the VIX at this level. 

However, IF JPOW comes out and re-assures the markets that all is well… no recession, we might pause and that banks are super strong… well honestly that could be enough to get the VIX into its extreme reversion to mean 12-14 area that we have not seen since 2019. So ask yourself this before you fomo in at 420 and VIX 15/16… are we really in a market status and time frame like 2019? Or is this more 2020-2023? 

I think we are setting up for one amazing long put opportunity myself. I will be watching the VIX and SPY closely at EOD tomorrow for a possible 90-120dte put entry.

Honestly what truly is blowing my mind right now is the fact that the dollar and the 10yr has been rallying in sync with us…. The last time DXY was at this level was March 20th when SPY closed at 393.74 and the last time the 10YR was at this level was March 15th when SPY closed at 389.28… call it $391 average and SPY is sitting almost $30 higher then it was last time DXY/ 10YR saw these levels…

Despite the real rollercoaster of a day that SPY had I actually had a really solid trading day. This week is shaping up to be just as amazing as the last 2 weeks of trading. I still have my NVDA and TSLA puts that are absolutely worthless and even with that loss I will realize tomorrow this is going to turn out to be a great week. 

I play to trade fairly lightly once JPOW starts talking and I honestly don’t hate the idea of a straddle going into it if premiums and IV are not too outrageous. IV is pretty low for tomorrow still and only have about a $3 move priced in… now that is 150% of the priced in move almost every single day this week so realistically a $4-5 move is probable tomorrow… meaning we either close the week out near 425 or near 415…**The A100 is the current market leader for AI tasks at $10,000-$18,000 per card. Its purchased by every major cloud vendor.**

**The A100 is the market leader because it has ASIC cores that accelerate the major ML libraries such as pytorch and tensorflow. Other vendors are years behind nvidia.**

* The market for HPC AI cards is currently $10B. Overall HPC market is $35B. Market projections are 20%-40% growth in AI HPC buys over the next 5 years. In the worst case projection that market becomes $25B, best case is $54B. Add in all HPC buys, and the projection for 2028 sits around $50B-$80B.
* Nvidia's current revenue is $24B split into gaming, embedded, HPC, and other markets, so there is a good case for it tripling revenue in 5 years just based on AI growth.

https://preview.redd.it/be28h4tdpn0b1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5fb26a7deceb7f0952ef049a3d31471aa66c5299

* There is currently a chip surplus, so Nvidia revenue is down overall because of reduced demand in other markets, but this is projected to change
* However, AI chips use the latest node processes from fabs (predominantly TSMC for AI), which are much more supply constrained than the overall chip market. The overall chip market is predominantly older processes.
* The A100 is currently selling over MSRP because firms are madly trying to scoop them up. In fact it is backordered by a month and a half on all major public vendors.
* This means nvidia is losing at least a month and a half of AI HPC revenue this year already due to supply problems. If they were not supply constrained, revenue would beat last year.
* Long term, Nvidia can renegotiate fab contracts to outbid other chip designers. Apple outbid everyone for the latest TSMC 5nm node process for their M1 chips, but seeing as A100s are being sold by scalpers for almost double MSRP, Nvidia can change this in coming years.

This is the original reason NVDA is going up. **Are NVDA detractors right saying its overvalued now that it has gone up almost 200% from lows this year? Yes its overvalued based even on the generous projected revenue above.**

Then why is it continuing to go up? Other factors for why NVDA is going up:

* Market tailwind from tech stocks overall going up. This can account for 1/3 of NVDA's rise, and will continue to dramatically effect it.
* Index funds rebalancing. NVDA is on the Nasdaq-100 which is tracked by many mutual funds and etfs. These funds are buying NVDA to rebalance their market-cap weighted portfolios.
* The "IT" stock. Investors are craving another crazy stock to cash in on. They've seen a stock as dumb as a certain video game store go to the moon, so why not a company that actually has some fundamentals?

Why $700 next year:

* Nasdaq-100 will go up at least 30%. This gives a baseline of $400 for NVDA next year
* The AI gold rush won't stop for another three years. NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI. NVDA is the public company, as a proportion of its revenue, that will be affected the most. This makes it the best company to invest in if you believe AI is the next miracle (I don't). This will mean it will outperform the market. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time
* FOMO. All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon. This will be around another 60% of today's value. All that together is 120%, and gives us $700.

**The Fed**

Your daily hawkish Fed talk.

Fed's Logan: current data doesn’t justify pause; concerned about whether inflation is falling fast enough; inflation is 'much too high,' restoring price stability is 'critical priority'; managing risks must not stop Fed from doing what's necessary to achieve 2% inflation.

Fed’s Jefferson: Inflation in nonhousing services has shown "no signs of significant decline”; will consider "all these factors" in deciding appropriate stance of monetary policy.

US Jobless Claims -22K To 242K In May-13 Wk; Survey 250K US May-6 Week Continuing Claims -8K to 1,799,000; last week’s jump might be due to claim fraud in MA. We need to see some really weak economic numbers before claims can go meaningfully up.

The probability of a June hike by the Fed literally went from 0% to over 40% in 2 weeks. However, the market is also predicting 1-2 rate cuts by the end of the year. So what the market really thinks is that the Fed is a bunch of fools who are going to screw it up.

US Conference Board Apr Leading Index -0.6%. 

“The LEI for the US declined for the thirteenth consecutive month in April, signaling a worsening economic outlook,” said Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, Senior Manager, Business Cycle Indicators, at The Conference Board. “Weaknesses among underlying components were widespread—but less so than in March’s reading, which resulted in a smaller decline. Only stock prices and manufacturers’ new orders for both capital and consumer goods improved in April. Importantly, the LEI continues to warn of an economic downturn this year. The Conference Board forecasts a contraction of economic activity starting in Q2 leading to a mild recession by mid-2023.”

However, when looking at the breakdowns, we may be reaching a bottom very soon. Credit likely already bottomed out, the interest rate spread should narrow after the debt ceiling issue is resolved, and new orders are expected to show less negative growth in May, indicating a potential pick-up.

The Philly Fed Index came in at -10.4, surpassing expectations of -19.5 and showing improvement from last month's reading of -31.3. The Philly Fed survey presents a contrasting picture compared to the NY Fed survey on Monday.

“Home sales are bouncing back and forth but remain above recent cyclical lows,” Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, said in a statement. “The combination of job gains, limited inventory and fluctuating mortgage rates over the last several months have created an environment of push-pull housing demand.” “Even in markets with lower prices, primarily the expensive West region, multiple-offer situations have returned in the spring buying season,” Yun said.

WMT double beat and boosted FY guidance. U.S. comp sales up 7.4%. Grocery, Health & Wellness up. General Merch down. Walmart CFO: "When consumers are coming to our stores we're seeing trade downs,"  "Their wallets are being stretched more thinly." CEO: "Inflation remained high, up low double digits and food categories...On a two-year stack basis, food inflation remains over 20% and continues to pressure discretionary wallets"

The rolling 120-day correlation between the S&P 500 (blue) and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (orange) has returned to positive territory. In my opinion, this confirms that the recent rally was driven by an increase in risk appetite. However, for the rally to sustain, interest rates would need to decrease from this point onward.

DM the [mod inbox/sex line](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets)TL;DR - A fed Pivot is not happening anytime soon. At best you will get a pause.

To everyone thinking the fed pivot is right around the corner:

If the economic storms get more difficult, traders and investors seem to think the Federal Reserve will be like a lifeguard and rescue all swimmers from the rip tides. Economists see such confidence as misplaced given the high inflation environment.

In general, investors and traders have been steadfast in their view they can count on the Fed to come running at the first hint of a downturn.

Traders in derivative markets have partly walked back rate-cut expectations, but still see the fed-funds rate — now at 5% to 5.25% — falling back to above 4.5% by year-end.

Behind this bet is the view that the central bank will pivot and lower rates at the first hint of a recession. After all, that was the Fed’s response after the last series of rate hikes in 2018- 2019.

But that’s not the playbook the Fed is following, economists say. The Fed has gone back to the lessons from the 1970s, the last time of high inflation.

The central lesson from that decade is that recessions don’t lower inflation on their own. The only way to get price pressures to cool is if the Fed is willing to keep policy tight, said Robert Brusca, chief economist at FAO Economics.

If the Fed turned around and cut rates like the market is pricing in for 2023, it would create “the worst of all possible worlds,” Brusca added.

Fed officials have been insisting they plan to keep policy “higher for longer” in this cycle.

On Monday, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin tied the strategy of holding rates high to research from his regional bank on the lessons of the 1970s.

“The number one lesson from the seventies is don’t quit too soon, don’t back off from fighting inflation because you’re worried about what the other consequences might be,” Barkin said in a recent Bloomberg Television interview.

If the Fed doesn’t finish the job, inflation will come back higher and the Fed would have to do even more damage to bring it down, Barkin added.

The late Marvin Goodfriend, the longtime director of economic research at the Richmond Fed, criticized Fed policy in the 1970s for being “go-stop.”

The Fed would keep policy too easy and then slam on the brakes.

Under this approach, inflation drifted up in the 1970s. It took Paul Volcker to engineer a recession and hike interest rates to 20% to wring high inflation out of the system.

Bond and stock-market investors alike have convinced themselves that the Fed will cut rates quickly this year, said Ethan Harris, head of global economic research at Bank of America Securities.

“The markets want to believe that the Fed is going to come to the rescue here. It is not just the bond market, \[it’s\] the equity market also. They haven’t convinced themselves that the Fed is going to accept the recession,” Harris said.

That indicates Market participants don’t appreciate how different this business cycle is from recent business cycles.

“The Fed hasn’t deliberately triggered a recession since Volcker. In all recent cycles the Fed backed off as soon as there was a whiff of recession,” he said. They were able to do that because inflation was low, he added.

“You really have to go back to the 70s and 80s to understand what they’re up to. Today is a mini-version of that and recent business cycles are not very informative for what the Fed is doing,” Harris said.

The Fed’s pivot in 2019, the last business cycle, was an experiment to allow the economy to run hot. “That experiment has failed miserably,” Harris said.

Predictions of a recession have ebbed and flowed since last summer. Right now, the number of economists predicting at least two quarters of contracting gross domestic product is rising.

One market-implied gauge saw over a 90% chance of a recession in the coming months. The Fed’s staff said in March that a mild recession was their base case.

Market expectations of rate cuts did firm considerably after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in mid-March.

Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said he thought the market pricing was reflecting the risk of the Fed having to slash rates in a banking crisis rather than one or two cuts.

The Fed has its first cuts penciled in for sometime in 2024. Officials see three 25 basis point cuts over that year.

Cramer says we’re in for a financial wave of prosperity.

"An economic wave is about to hit that will be fantastic for investors," he says in a recent column on CNBC's Investing Club.

If the law of inverse Cramer holds, we’re due for a depression the likes of which the world has never seen.

Positions: BBBY bag holder, missed on BABA and DIS earnings“**During a gold rush, sell shovels.”** This saying arose following the California gold rush of the mid-19th century when it became clear that few prospectors made money panning for gold while the suppliers who sold them shovels and picks profited nicely. 

**I. Introduction** 

This due diligence report focuses on the *Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)* and Autonomous Vehicles sector. It aims to provide an overview of the industry, including the latest technological advancements, market trends, and investment opportunities within this rapidly evolving field. Mainly, employing the strategy of "During a gold rush, sell shovels." The aim is to identify key products and companies within the supply chain that can benefit from the industry's growth and technological advancements. 

**II. Autonomous Driving Technologies Industry Overview**

ADAS & Autonomous Vehicles industry is experiencing significant growth and transformation, driven by evolving consumer preferences, technological advancements, and regulatory initiatives. These technologies aim to enhance road safety, increase transportation efficiency, and provide improved mobility options. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) utilize a combination of sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning algorithms to perceive the environment and make informed driving decisions. In USA, this industry is regulated by the *National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).*

Automakers are moving past passive safety (airbags, seal belts, etc..) into active safety (ADAS features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance, automatic emergency braking, and blind-spot monitoring, etc...).

Automobile OEMs are racing to deliver the first automobile offering level 4 ADAS system. Mercedes currently has level 3 offering to consumers. ADAS unlock a major source of subscription-based revenue for automobile OEMS. 

ADAS are categorized into different levels based on the amount of automation, and the scale provided by *The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)*. ADAS can be divided into 5 levels:

[5 levels of ADAS\/AVs](https://preview.redd.it/fzfjl9nn5m0b1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=88f6a64d59eda5088696454a11be86b0c71bb758)

**III. Government Regulation**

*National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)* and other agencies around the globe will regulate ADAS requirements and standards. Germany is leading the way with the USA following closely behind. Most likely, AVs will be required to have more than one type of sensor (camera, radar, lidar, ultrasonics/sonar) to offer level 3 and above ADAS features. This is due to requiring a high degree of redundancy for safety reasons. 

In my personal opinion, Tesla's pure camera vision is a bust. This is evident by the increasing number of accidents involving Tesla when Autopilot was engaged. Also, certain environmental factors can hinder cameras useless (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc..). Elon will never admit this and will blame his failures on government interference. 

**IV. Technological Advancements in the Supply Chain**

 The ADAS and autonomous vehicle industry has witnessed a surge in investments and strategic partnerships, indicating the growing interest and confidence in this sector. Established automakers, technology companies, and ride-sharing platforms are actively pursuing collaborations to leverage their respective expertise and accelerate the development and commercialization of ADAS and autonomous vehicles. 

ADAS = Chipmakers + Real Time Operating System + Automotive Cloud + Sensors + Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 

*Chipmakers:*

* Mobileye (Spun off, but still controlled, by Intel)
* Nvidia DRIVE Hyperion Platform
* Qualcomm Snapdragon Ride Flex Soc

*Real Time Operating System (RTOS):*

* BlackBerry QNX already has deals with automotive OEMs to offer them their RTOS.

*Automotive Cloud:*

* Volkswagen Automotive Cloud (powered Microsoft Azure)
* Blackberry IVY (powered by Amazon AWS)

*Sensors:*

* Microvision (LiDAR) - Most likely, all AVs that offer level 3 ADAS and above will need to be equipped with a lidar sensor. The LiDAR sector has consolidated, and MVIS aims to take over 50% of the automotive market. MVIS shareholders just authorized an additional 100 million shares. Currently, a major squeeze is being anticipated. Get in while you can!

*Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:*

* ADAS is going to be a major revenue stream for automotive OEMs. Most likely, will be a subscription-based model.
* All the automotive OEMs have their own version. The race to offer Level 3 and above is currently underway. Here are a few examples:
* Autopilot by Tesla
* Bluecruise by Ford
* Super Cruise by GM
* Subaru Eyesight
* Honda Automated Drive
* Mercedes Drive Pilot (level 3)
* ETC...

**V. Conclusion**

When considering investment opportunities in the ADAS and autonomous vehicle sector, it is essential to identify companies that demonstrate technological leadership, strong partnerships, and a clear roadmap for future growth. These companies are likely to be at the forefront of innovation and well-positioned to capitalize on the market trends and evolving consumer demands.

In conclusion, the ADAS and autonomous vehicle industry is witnessing a transformative phase characterized by increased investment and strategic partnerships. Automakers, technology companies, and ride-sharing platforms are actively collaborating to advance technology, share resources, and accelerate the market adoption of ADAS and autonomous vehicles.
